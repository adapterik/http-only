  <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/236" original-href="CallForParticpation.html" archive-page-id="236">NSC92</a> will take place in Pisa, Italy. Pisa is situated in Tuscany
  on the Arno river. The Italian poet Gabriele D'ANNUNZIO named  Pisa's
  Piazza della  Torre: "The Square  of Miracles", and yet the definition
  could be extended with equal justice to the whole city. Pisa is not
  only an art center with few rivals;  it is steeped in culture  and
  science  and  offers  an  up-to-date  infrastructure.  The conference
  will  be held  at the  Palazzo dei  Congressi, near  the city center
  and at walking distance to the Hotels.</div>
