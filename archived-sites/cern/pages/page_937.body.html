  <h1>The problem of linking to living documents</h1>

  <p>
    A problem arises when one user wants to refer to a portion of another
    document to which he does not have write access.  The reference to
    a part of the document must remain as valid as possible when the document
    is updated. </p>
  <p>
    The solution set is as follows: take your pick.
  </p>
  <h2>The document is frozen.</h2>
  This in fact applies nicely to mail messages and news articles which,
  once published, are unretractable.  You can refer to a part of these
  messages by character range (line and character etc).
  <h2>Versions are kept.</h2>
  If the document itself is not frozen, one can still refer to a particular
  version of it if a record of versions is kept.  This requires that
  the server provdie an additional protocol funtion, which is to tell
  a client exactly which part (if any) of the current version of a document
  is the part corresponds to a particular part of  an older version.
  This translation can be <a name="3">generated automatically</a> by the "diff" engine
  used by most source code control systems. These systems do not always
  work: a smart editor would be able to keep better track.
  <p>
    This is an interesting option, because the operations needed to do
    it are the same as those needed for putting links onto plain text
    documents and keeping track of versions, both of which are important
    aspects of collaborative software design.</p>

  <h2>The document is writable by the annotater.</h2>
  In this case, when the person refering to the document has write access
  to it, he can insert marks. This is the way the current (1992) NeXTStep
  editor works: it embeds anchors in the destination document. If the
  document is later edited, the anchors are moved around with the text,
  though in some cases (drastic rewriting) they can disappear.
  <h2>Everything is numbered</h2>
  This solution requires the author (or rather, the author's editing
  program) to give unique identifiers to every part of a document which
  can be the destination of a link.  This is not in fact a ridiculous
  overhead if handled efficiently.    There must be a certain granularity
  (paragrpah, for example) which prevents people linking to precise
  words, and this is a drawback.
  <h2>Linking by context</h2>
  In this case, the annotater refers to a part of the document by the
  context: for example, he quotes the first and last pieces. See for,
  example, the section "In this case...". This method is clearly heuristic
  and prone to failures just as is the <a name="4" href="#3">automatic generation</a> of differences
  above..</div>
