  <h1>EAN GUI</h1>
  The "<a name="2" href="/archive/cern/921" original-href="../../../CUI/Overview.html" archive-page-id="921">Centre Universitaire d'Informatique (CUI)</a>" of the University
  of Geneva proposes to show to a large public its graphical user interface
  (X-windows based) for the EAN software. We see the following reasons
  and benefits for this:
  <ul>
    <li>The EanGUI eventually will be included in the official RARE-supported
      EAN version 3.0 release (it is "public domain" for the research community).
      Many network operators and computing center managers may see here
      a working demo for the first time.
    </li>
    <li>As an easy to use mail interface it is best suited for novice and
      non-expert users and thus helps to promote MHS.
    </li>
    <li>The EanGUI was built because currently there are not a lot of commercialy
      available GUIs for eMail - the EanGUI can help to persuade software
      companies (present at the conference?) in starting the development
      of such products.
    </li>
  </ul>
