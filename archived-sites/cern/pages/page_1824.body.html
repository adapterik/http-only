  <h1>Anchors</h1>
  Anchors represent parts of graphic objects which may be the sources
  or destinations of links. Here follows a general description of thir
  implementation in the <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/763" original-href="BrowserOverview.html" archive-page-id="763">WWW architecure</a>. (See <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/29" original-href="../Terms.html#anchor" archive-page-id="29">definition</a>)
  <p>
    An anchor be the source of no, one, or many <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/29" original-href="../Terms.html#link" archive-page-id="29">links</a>. It has one "main"
    link for the (common) case in which it is the source for one link.
    (In the w3 software, only the main link is normally used - jan 92)</p>
  <p>
    An anchor may be the destination of no, one, or many links.  The anchor
    module stores all links known by the program, and so in fact manages
    a copy of a small part of the web.</p>
  <p>
    There are two types of anchors: Parenet anchors and child anchors.
  </p>
  <h2>Parent anchors</h2>
  These represent whole documents.  Every <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/763" original-href="BrowserOverview.html#14" archive-page-id="763">graphic object</a> has an associated
  parent anchor. Associated with a parent anchor is data including:
  <ul>
    <li>The title of the associated document, if known. This allows the document's
      title to be displayed in lists of previous nodes visited,  etc., even
      when the document itself has been freed.
    </li>
    <li>A flag as to whether the document is an index.
    </li>
    <li>The address of the document.  When a new anchor is created, the code
      ensures that if an anchor with that address already exists, that that
      anchor is returned instead, so no duplicates can exist.
    </li>
    <li>A list of children
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Child anchors</h2>
  These represent parts of documents.  The graphic object stores the
  correlation between  the id of the anchor and the actual space (time)
  shape which is referred to. Child anchors contain
  <ul>
    <li>A pointer to the parent.
    </li>
  </ul>
