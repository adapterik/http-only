  <h1>Installation</h1>
  To install the <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/18" original-href="WorldWideWeb.html" archive-page-id="18">WorldWideWeb</a> program properly you will need to be superuser.
  It is possible to use take a private copy of the program<a name="1" href="#private"> (see below)</a>
  if you really have to, but for a system-wide copy, the steps are as
  follows. If you are at CERN, you should use NFS to remotely mount
  the files (see <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/773" original-href="UsingNFS.html" archive-page-id="773">explanation</a> ).  REMEMBER THE dwrite you need<a name="15" href="#14"> below</a>.
  <ul>
    <li>Make a suitable directory to hold the release. cd to that directory.
    </li>
    <li>Get the tar file using <a name="13" href="/archive/cern/28" original-href="../LineMode/Defaults/Distribution.html" archive-page-id="28">anonymous FTP</a> .
    </li>
    <li>Take the .tar file using ftp or whatever (see <a name="12" href="/archive/cern/27" original-href="../../README.html" archive-page-id="27">distribution</a> ) and unwrap
      it using tar .
    </li>
    <li>Become superuser
    </li>
    <li>
      <a name="4">Make a soft link from your LocalApps directory to the file WorldWideWeb
        itself</a> .
    </li>
  </ul>
  The commands to do this are therefore (inserting the full path name
  of your directory where indicated, and the version number for vvv):-
  <xmp>		tar -xf WWWNeXTStepEditor_vvv.tar
    su root
    mkdir /LocalApps
    ln -s /(fullpathname)/WorldWideWeb.app /LocalApps
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Don't do the mkdir step if you already have a /LocalApps directory
  <h3><a name="private">Making a private copy</a></h3>
  If you don't have privilege, and you don't have the ear of someone
  who does, it is possible to take a private copy of the program. It
  is better, of course, to get it installed system-wide, but if desperate,
  procede as above but instead link the application to your own directory,
  and take a copy of the system default file as your own default file.
  The commands are therefore:-
  <xmp>		tar -xf WWWMeXTStepEditor_vvv.tar
    ln -s /(fullpathname)/WorldWideWeb ~/Apps
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h3><a name="6">Personal setup</a></h3>
  Each person who wants to use it on the machine, whether it is a system
  copy or his private copy, must before he can use WWW:
  <ul>
    <li>Set his default NewsHost (can this be done system-wide?) to be the
      name of a server running the NNTP protocol. If he is already using
      "News" this will be unnecessary, as WWW will use News's default. (At
      CERN only, at the time of writing, a suitable news host was cernvax.cern.ch.)
      The <a name="14">shell command</a> is
    </li>
  </ul>
  <xmp>       		dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost (hostname)
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  You (each user) may later want to create your own WWW subdirectory
  under your home directory. In that subdirectory you may like to put
  :
  <ul>
    <li>A personal hypertext home page. This is a file default.html which
      will be displayed whenever the application is started. Create it by
      starting WWW to load the system default home page,  editing it, then
      using the "<a name="11" href="/archive/cern/158" original-href="Menus.html#21" archive-page-id="158"> Save a copy in..HTML..</a> " item in the Window menu, and
      selecting your private WWW subdirectory.
    </li>
    <li>A personal blank note. This is a file blank.html which will be used
      as a template whenever you create a new hypertext file with the "<a name="9" href="/archive/cern/158" original-href="Menus.html#22" archive-page-id="158">
        New file</a> " or "<a name="10" href="/archive/cern/158" original-href="Menus.html#16" archive-page-id="158"> Link to new</a> " commands. Create it  by using the "<a name="8" href="/archive/cern/158" original-href="Menus.html#22" archive-page-id="158">
        New file</a> " item in the "Window" menu and selecting your personal $(HOME)/WWW/blank.html
      as filename.
    </li>
    <li>A default <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/772" original-href="Styles.html" archive-page-id="772">style sheet</a> .</li>
  </ul>
