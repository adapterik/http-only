  <h1>CERN News groups</h1>
  Do not confuse CERN news with <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/374" original-href="../News/Overview.html" archive-page-id="374">Internet news</a> .The CERN internal news
  system contains groups which are public, and those which are private.
  You can find the public ones from the <a name="14" href="/archive/cern/730">list</a>. There are other  private
  groups not mentioned there: to access them you need to know the name.
  If you want to access a private group, you can do it explicitly with
  the command
  <xmp>		www "http://crnvmc.cern.ch./NEWS/</xmp>
  <pre><groupname>"

</groupname></pre>
  where  is the name of your private group, or a number of groups separated
  by plus signs. ("Quotes" necessary on VMS only.) You can build links
  to private groups from your group home page. __________________________________________________________
