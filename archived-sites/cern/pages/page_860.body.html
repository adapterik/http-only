  <h1>From Version to Version of HTTP</h1>
  <h2>Current version of HTTP</h2>
  I propose 0.9 as the number of the <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/1863" original-href="HTTP0.9Summary.html" archive-page-id="1863">current version</a> .
  <h2>Compatibility</h2>
  Today (June 1992) WWW is used in a community of highly computer literate
  people. The cost of making all users adopt a new, incompatible version
  of the browser and/or the server is not very high, neither in effort
  nor in inconvenience.
  <p>
    Nevertheless, I will propose to go to a new version in a compatible
    way. [Absolutely -- we can require complete back-compatibility for
    both clients and servers - Tim]
  </p>
  <h2>Imperatives</h2>
  Browsers and servers must have a few <a name="8" href="/archive/cern/1863" original-href="HTTP0.9Summary.html#1" archive-page-id="1863">characteristics</a> that must be
  kept over all versions.
  <h2>What has a version?</h2>
  A version is associated with the HTTP protocol used in the exchange
  between servers and browsers.  Because two agents on two different
  machines are involved, there can be two different implementations
  of the protocol at work. The version of the browser or the server
  refers to its capabilities in displaying or providing, not to the
  protocol. Perhaps a Browser or server should be characterised by both
  numbers:  Linemode 3.4/2.0 would mean browser version 3.4 using HTTP
  2.0. [Hang on -- let's not complicate things unduly. The software
  has a version number, and so does the protocol but they're nothing
  to do with each other]
  <p>
    An HTTP version number consists of 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>an integer indicating the set of features,
    </li>
    <li>a dot,
    </li>
    <li>an integer indicating the level, whereby the differences between,
      say, 2.01 and 2.02 must be such that ANY two version 2 implementations
      must be able to communicate without problems.
    </li>
  </ul>
  [So you require back-compatibility between "major" versions number
  before the dot changing] and both-ways compatibility between "minor"
  versions? -- DEC jargon]
  <h2>Aims</h2>
  In a new version of HTTP, there can be added features, but there can
  also be a lack of deprecated ones. Communication between a browser
  using version n and a server using version m should in some sense
  be possible.
  <p>
    It is reasonable to require that an agent using version n+1 also still
    knows how to handle version n but does not have to know version n-1.
  </p>
  <h2>Forwards</h2>
  There are three disjoint elements:
  <ul>
    <li>the WWW data model, which today consists of documents which may have
      explicit links and/or be queryable with text-based queries. [Was:
      maybe I'd prefer to call data bases, since an index is a reference
      table built from a data base to ease access to it)."    An index can
      be many <a name="9" href="/archive/cern/231" original-href="WhatIsAnIndex.html" archive-page-id="231">things</a> ] There is no reason why other types should not be
      added, such as time-indefinite communications (eg. a telnet session,
      TV or process control).[Is this really different from a document?]
    </li>
    <li>the HTTP protocol, which should be defined outside the document contents.
      It needs to evolve and expand.
    </li>
    <li>the HTML markup which is today the only implemented format we accept
      for the document contents. Here certainly we want more.
    </li>
  </ul>
  The next releases should distinguish these cleanly. One way is to
  talk HTTP over a control connection and documents over a data connection.
  <h2>Pragmatism</h2>
  Having suggested a split of control and data, I realise that at present
  this is too much, and so we must keep going on one connection. [Ample
  justification for this is the difference in reponse time from HTTP
  servers and FTP servers -- the latter using 2 connections] That implies
  though that we must do our own transmission protocol inside HTTP,
  ie. when we send, say, binary data, then because we mix HTTP and data
  on the same connection, we have to do things inside HTTP like "here
  follows 3406 bytes of binary data" because otherwise we are not guaranteed
  to be able to distinguish between HTTP controls and document data.
  <h2>Proposed modifications</h2>
  <h3>Version 1.0:</h3>
  The HTTP version number is sent in every communication, by the browser
  after the argument to GET, by the server in a tag at the start. [I
  don't see the reason for this version.]
  <h3>Version 2.0:</h3>
  The HTTP version number is sent at the start of every communication.
  <p>
    The HTTP commands are not in HTML; however, they are mixed in with
    the data stream. [I would say they envelop the data stream. I think
    it is important to keep the TOEOF style as an option because it is
    so practical]</p>
