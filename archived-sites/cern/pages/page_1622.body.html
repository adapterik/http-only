  <h1>CONCISE commands</h1>
  This section is designed to introduce the commands (ie. the instructions)
  that you can give to CONCISE. It is suggested that you try each of
  the commands in turn as you read through the text. Use your electronic
  mail system; send a message to the CONCISE service at one of the addresses
  given in section 2, and where you usually type the message itself,
  type in the commands given below. Send the message in the usual way,
  and wait to see what reply you get. The reply may come back in a few
  minutes, or you might have to wait longer depending on the speed of
  the electronic mail.
  <p>
    At the beginning of each message, before any of the commands are put
    in, you must include the following line:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    start
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  This tells CONCISE to start obeying commands, anything put before
  this line will be ignored. See the following sections on other commands:
