  <h1>BIDS ISI Demonstration</h1>
  This demonstration will show the ISI Citation Index service now available
  across JANET to 63 subscribing Higher Education Institutions in the
  UK.
  <p>
    The criteria that determined the current design will be reviewed,
    and the resulting interface demonstrated.  Attention will be focussed
    on the JANET related features that formed an important part of the
    functionality, including the use of e-mail for the posting of results.</p>
  <p>
    Context-sensitive on-line help is a very important strength of the
    service, and this will also be demonstrated.</p>
  <p>
    Finally, work that is in progress to develop a graphical user interface
    to the service will be illustrated with a brief demonstration.</p>
