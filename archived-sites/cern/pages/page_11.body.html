  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions on W3</h1>
  An FAQ list is really a cop-out from
  managed information. You should be
  able to find everything you want
  to know by browsing from the WWW
  project page, as everything should
  be arranged in a logical way. Here
  though are things which maybe didn't
  fit into the structure, with pointers
  to the answers which maybe did. Its
  an experiment, started May 92. The
  questioners are anonymous.
