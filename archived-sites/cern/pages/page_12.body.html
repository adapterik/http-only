  <h1>General Overview</h1>
  There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web.
  You can look at it from many points of view.
  If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for
  information.
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <a href="/archive/cern/13" original-href="bySubject/Overview.html" archive-page-id="13">by Subject</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete
      but easiest to use.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      <a href="/archive/cern/61" original-href="ByAccess.html" archive-page-id="61">by Type</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc)
      may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node
  or the subject list.
