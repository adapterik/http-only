  <h2>Who is BRUNO?</h2>
  Giordano Bruno (1584-1600) was a member of the Dominican order.  TheDominicans
  had kept alive the Greek secrets of memory, first perfectedby the
  poet Simonides of Ceos (c.556-468?B.C.).  Before the printingpress,
  mnemonic methods for remembering verse or other forms ofknowledge
  were the only ways to pass that information on.
  <p>
    Bruno, after mastering the Dominican secrets, revealed them to therest
    of the world in his classic, Shadow of Ideas (1582).  A notedadvocate
    of free thought, Bruno was accused by the Inquisition in 1592 of various
    acts of heresy, including making bad jokes about God. He was convicted
    and burned at the stake in 1600.
