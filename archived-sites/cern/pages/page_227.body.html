  <h2>Files you need</h2>
  Using anonymous FTP, pick up the tar file ViolaWWW_920515.tar.Z from
  the /pub/www/src directory on info.cern.ch. Uncompress it and un tar
  it. You will get a new directory ViolaWWW_920515 under which you will
  find the apps directory and a bin directory (and a src directory you
  don't need) Write a small shell script like
  <xmp>
    #! /bin/csh
    /.../bin/viola.decstation -path /.../apps &amp;
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Call this script vw, give it execute mode
  <xmp>
    chmod +x vw
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  and put it into some directory which is in your path (like your own
  bin or /usr/local/bin if you can be root). Of course in the script
  above replace the ... with the actual path name of wherever you have
  put the viola files. Type
  <xmp>
    rehash
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  so that your shell knows about the new command. That's all I think
  you need to do. Just type
  <xmp>
    vw
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  When the application starts, click on the big question-mark for help.
