  <h1>DCL Server</h1>
  It is possible to write a W3 server in DCL, the VMS command interpreter
  language. This has the advantage (over C for example) of quick prototyping
  and easy access to the VMS systems functions available in DCL.  Seee
  also:
  <p>
    The <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/810">KVI WWW server</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Server structure</h2>
  The server must run in a DCL environment. That is, if it is run as
  a detached process, this must be done by running LOGINOUT.EXE with
  a command file as input. That command file will run the server executable
  WWW_SERVER.EXE.
  <p>
    The WWW_SERVER.EXE program will loop waiting for connection from a
    W3 client. When it gets one, it calls a DCL command of your choice
    (defined at WWW_SERVER.EXE compile time) passsing it the device name
    of the channel for communication with the client, the document id
    requested, and search terms if any. The DCL command (here we assume
    it is a call to a command file) analyses the request and returns the
    result ot the client through the given channel.</p>
  <p>
    The WWW_SERVER.EXE program may also be run from the command line for
    testing:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    $ g :== $disk$whatever:[full.dir.spec]www_server.exe
    $ g -a *:8000 -v
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Note here the server <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/737" original-href="User/CommandLine.html" archive-page-id="737">command line options</a> which are the same as for
  the basic W3 daemon. The -a option specifies the port number to listen
  on as 8000. Note the process needs some sort of privilege to run with
  port numbers below 1024. the -v option turns on diagnostic output
  to the terminal.
  <h2>Source</h2>
  The source files all can be taken from the regualar WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z
  distribution file except:

    </dt>
    <dd> The C code module which calls the DCL file. A #define
      in this module defines the DCL file name.

      DOCDB gateway in fact).

    </dt>
    <dd> The MMS (VMS Module Managment System) description file
      which contains the command to build the server. If you don't have
      MMS, you can probably figure out how to build it by reading this file.
    </dd>

  <h2>Writing the DCL file</h2>
  When you write the DCL file, you should bear in mind that the W3 protocol
  is a telnet-style protocol, and requires each line to be terminated
  with a CR, LF pair. (Carriage Return, Line feed, ASCII 13,10). The
  example code shows how you can append a CRLF pair  to the end of a
  DCL output line.
  <p>
    The first parameter passed to the command file is the device name
    of the internet socket. This must be opened for write by the DCL file.
    Thanks to Jonathan Streets (FNAL) for figuring that bit out.
  </p>
  <h2>Building the server</h2>
  To make the WWW_SERVER.EXE file, you run MMS with the macro MULTINET=1
  defined. Put the MMS file as descrip.mms in the same directory.
  <xmp>
    $ MMS/macro=(multinet=1)
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  The code has been tested with Multinet/TCP-IP. If you run it with
  UCX or WIN_TCP, you should define one of those instead of MULTINET.
  (see the descrip file.) This code worked with MULTINET -- it is possible
  that the method of getting the socket device name and passing it to
  the DCL file doesn't work with UCX or WIN_TCP. (The code as is has
  been slightly stripped down scince the last tes, so any typos are
  mine - TBL)</div>
