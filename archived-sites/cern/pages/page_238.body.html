  <h1>Fourth ACM conference on Hypertext</h1>
  Sponsored by SIGLINK, SIGIR, SIGOIS In cooperation with Politecnico
  di Milano, AICA, commission of European Communities, GMD, INRIA, NEC,
  NTT, LINK IT!, SIGCHI
  <p>
    November 30/December 4, 1992, Milano (Italy)
  </p>
  <h2>Scope</h2>
  ECHT'92 is the second in a series of European conferences on Hypertext
  and Hypermedia in alternation with the U.S. based Hypertext conferences
  coordinated and sponsored by ACM. ECHT'92 is a major event where researchers,
  developers and users can meet around the theme of Hypertext and Hypermedia.
  <p>
    The broad applicability of Hypertext and Hypermedia as a primary technology
    in many domains and its efficiency as an information integrator has
    led to increased interest from industry as well as recognition from
    academia. By their very nature, Hypertext and Hypermedia are at the
    intersection of many fields, including computer science, cognitive
    science, education, and communication. They are also relevant for
    many application domains. ECHT'92 will be of interest to a broad spectrum
    of professionals ranging from theoreticians to system and application
    developers, from researchers to authors and end-users.</p>
  <p>
    The conference will include prominent guest speakers, presentations
    of refereed papers, panel sessions, technical briefing sessions, poster
    and video presentations, as well as demonstrations of experimental
    research prototypes and commercial products. The conference will also
    feature two days of introductory and advanced tutorials on a variety
    of topics. There will be opportunities for informal meetings of special
    interest groups.
  </p>

  <h2>Papers</h2>
  Technical papers relate original work or integrative review (theoretical,
  empirical, systems). We discourage simple presentations of projects
  or commercial products. We encourage emphasizing "experiences", "lessons
  learned" or "integrative reviews". Papers should provide a clear scientific
  message to the audience, place the presented work in context within
  the field, cite related work and clearly indicate the innovative aspects
  of the work. Submissions: Full papers (less than 6000 words) should
  be submitted in five paper copies. A separate cover page must contain
  the title of the paper, name(s), affiliation(s) and complete mailing
  address(es) (incl. phone, telefax, e-mail) of the author(s) together
  with an abstract (about 200 words) and 35 keywords. Please send an
  e-mail version of the abstract with title, name(s), address(es) and
  affiliation(s) to the conference secretariat as soon as possible.

  <h2>Tutorials</h2>
  Courses enhance the skills and broaden the perspective of their attendees.
  Courses should be designed to provide advanced technical training
  in an area, or to introduce a rigorous framework for learning a new
  area. Courses can be proposed for half-day (3 hours) or full-day (6
  hours) length. Courses that focus narrowly on a particular product
  or research agenda, are not appropriate. A non exhaustive list of
  appealing areas is: hypertext in education; hypertext for cultural
  applications; technical hyperdocumentation; hypertext system implementation;
  multimedia technology; evaluation and criticism; methodologies and
  approaches to hypertext authoring; interface design; film, video,
  and visual rhetorics; artificial reality. Courses will be selected
  on the basis of the instructors' qualification for teaching the proposed
  course and the contribution to the overall conference program.
  <p>
    Submission: proposals should describe the content of the course and
    its format (1000-2000 words), should identify the target audience,
    the level of expertise required, and the length</p>
  <p>
    (1 or 2 half days). Qualification and profile of the instructor(s)
    should also be included. A separate page containing title, name(s),
    affiliation(s) and complete mailing address(es) (incl. phone, telefax,
    e-mail) of the instructor(s) must be provided.</p>

  <h2>Panels</h2>
  Panels are meant to provide an interactive forum for involving both
  panelists and audience in lively discussions and exchanges of different
  points of view. Panels for ECHT '92 will not take the almost "traditional"
  format of symposia or mini paper sessions in disguise. Instead ECHT'92
  panels will focus on lively discussions by panelists who bring different
  perspectives to an important and controversial topic. Panelists should
  not present lengthy position statements. Panels should be moderated
  by someone who is comfortable interviewing panel members, interrupting
  panelists at appropriate times, keeping the discussion on track and
  being able to weave together the thoughts of the panel members. The
  panel should address fundamental issues,questions and approaches which
  are of current interest focusing on specific topics rather than dealing
  with broad and general areas.
  <p>
    Submissions: moderators are invited to provide a description of the
    proposed panel by submitting 3-5 pages listing the topic (e.g., by
    providing leading questions to be raised by the moderator), the specific
    format intended, the names and affiliations of the panelists with
    their specific backgrounds and their positions on the (hopefully controversial)
    issues of the panel. Panel statements will appear in the proceedings.</p>
  <p>
    A separate cover page must contain the title of the panel, names,
    affiliations and complete mailing addresses (incl. phone, telefax,
    e-mail) of the panelists.</p>

  <h2>Demonstrations, posters, and videos</h2>
  Demonstrations provide the attendees with the opportunity to experience
  hypertext systems and question the developers of the systems. Poster
  presentations give researchers the opportunity to present significant
  work in progress or late-breaking results and to discuss their work
  with those attendees most deeply interested in the topic. Videos are
  appropriate for illustrating concepts that are best captured visually.
  <p>
    Submissions: demonstrations and posters should be submitted in the
    form of an extended abstract (approx.1000 words), describing the content,
    the relevance for the conference and what is noteworthy about the
    presented work. Demonstrators are informed that they must provide
    their own hardware. Videos should be submitted in the form of a 5
    to 10 minutes VHS, PAL or NTSC tape, with a 500 words abstract, describing
    the content, relevance and noteworthiness as above. A separate page
    must contain the title of the demo, poster or video, name(s), affiliation(s)
    and complete mailing address(es) (incl. phone, telefax, e-mail) of
    the author(s).</p>

  <h2>Technical Briefings</h2>
  Technical briefings aim at providing a presentation medium for presenting
  details of a concrete design rather than an empirical or theoretical
  contribution. Presentations should emphasize experience in the design
  and implementation of hypertext systems or applications, and discuss
  decision points and trade-offs. Briefings are intended to deliver
  valuable technical messages to the audience. Briefings are encouraged
  to be accompanied by a live interaction with the system.
  <p>
    Submissions: Proposals (approx. 1500 words) should be submitted in
    five paper copies and outline the points to be made in the briefing.
    A separate page must contain the title of the briefing. name(s), affiliation(s)
    and complete mailing address(es) (incl. phone, telefax, e-mail) of
    the author(s).</p>

  <h2>Milan: beyond industry</h2>
  For many people, Milan, the economic capital of Italy, is represented
  by its industriousness, its industries, and advanced services sector.
  It is usually considered a rather drab city with hardly an history
  that is totally concentrated on production.
  <p>
    As a matter of fact, the origins of Milan are extremely ancient. The
    city first developed under the Romans who named it Mediolanum (which
    means "the land in the middle") because its ideal geographical position
    made it an important hub for trade.</p>
  <p>
    The vestiges of this period can still be seen throughout the city
    center. During the Medieval Era Milan was a free municipality. Later
    on it became a part of the seigniory of Visconti and Sforza dynasties,
    and subsequently fell under Spanish and Austrian rule.</p>
  <p>
    The city urban layout continued to systematically expand in successive
    concentric circles. Different customs, the arts, and culture flourished
    in each of these periods.</p>
  <p>
    The Cathedral, "il Duomo", for years considered the tallest building
    in Italy, was built between the 13th and 15th centuries. The "Navigli"
    - artificial waterways- which permitted trade as well as the transportation
    of large blocks of marble for the construction of the Cathedral were
    also built during that period.</p>
  <p>
    Many artists lived in Milan when the city was a part of the Sforza
    seigniory. Leonardo da Vinci sojourned in Milan various times between
    1482 and 1513. Here he created masterpieces such as the frescoes in
    the hall of the Rafters in the Sforza Castle and the "Last supper"
    fresco in the Santa Maria delle Grazie Convent.</p>
  <p>
    Although the period under Spanish rule (1535-1706) was marked by the
    plague and a decrease in population, the years under Austrian rule
    on the contrary, were characterized by flourishing cultural and economic
    activities.</p>
  <p>
    The La Scala Theatre, which the sovereign had called the "Most beautiful
    theater in the world", was also created in this period. Designed by
    Piermarini and inaugurated in 1778, La Scala immediately became the
    point of encounter between high society and culture, and decreed the
    success of operas by Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi.</p>
  <p>
    Therefore, Milan, a city where culture, art, reformist ideals and
    industriousness have always been indissolubly linked, is considered
    by many as the second capital of Italy.</p>
  <p>
    Today the connection between entrepreneurial activities and creativity
    has made Milan the capital of fashion, design, publishing, and advertising.
    Almost all of the most famous designers and advertising executives
    live and work in Milan.</p>
  <p>
    Milan is also host to the Modit and Milanovendemoda exhibitions, events
    that have established Italian ready-to-wear fashion in the world;
    the Furniture Show, a biennial exhibit of the best Italian furniture
    production and design; and many other commercial and cultural events.</p>
  <p>
    Moreover most of the publishing houses and the headquarters of fashion
    and design magazines are located in Milan.</p>
  <p>
    However those persons who are not a part of the creative world can
    always find an interesting exhibit or trade fair to visit in Milan
    such as SMAU, one of the most important exhibitions of innovations
    in information technology, telecommunications, and office furniture.</p>
  <p>
    Having cast off the drab mantle of the industrial city, for some years
    now in Milan has been pointing towards the advanced services sector
    and the post-industrial era.</p>
  <p>
    The shopping opportunities are extremely vast, from the most sophisticated
    boutiques to skillfully made artisan objects, from shopping centers
    to specialized stores.</p>
  <p>
    Milan's excellent connections with the most important tourist spots
    in Italy should also be emphasized: one can reach the picturesque
    lakes area in about an hour or take a short trip to go skiing on the
    Alps or swimming in the sea near Portofino. Venice, Florence, and
    Rome can be easily reached by fast trains: the "Pendolino", the new
    super fast commuter train, arrives in Rome in just three hours and
    50 minutes.</p>
  <p>
    Surrounded by sea, mountains, and lakes the city of Milan in equilibrium
    between past, present and future, has much to offer to the visitor
    wanting to discover it.</p>
