  <h1>X11 browsers for W3</h1>
  Under X11, the following possibilities exist for accessing W3 data.
  See the list of <a href="/archive/cern/16" original-href="../Status.html" archive-page-id="16">W3 products</a>.
  <ul>
    <li>The Viola project provides an interface to W3 (violawww)
    </li>
    <li>The Erwise browser, running using Motif;
    </li>
    <li>The tkWWW browser using the TK toolkit
    </li>
    <li>The MidasWWW browser using Midas gadgets;
    </li>
    <li>Dan Connolly at Convex, Inc. has developped a browser under motif using
      Tcl. unfortunately not public domian.
    </li>
    <li>Dan has made available code to make Frame into a HTML editor.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Other interesting possibilities for this include building one on top
  of
  <ul>
    <li>The Andrew toolkit (ATK) from Carnegie Mellon University.
      (The sources are released with X11).
    </li>
    <li>The TMlib library from someone at Apollo. The distribution terms are
      basically free. I have the code and documentation.
    </li>
    <li>The "interviews" C++ toolkit on top of X11
    </li>
    <li>The  C++ wrappers for Motif which have been made sort of public (but
      would need licensing agreements) from univerity of Lowell.
    </li>
    <li>The Tcl toolkit, as used by Dan.  A Tcl hypertext widget is now available
      from somewhere.
    </li>
  </ul>
