  <h1>Searching</h1>
  Another way of finding out what items there are to go to, is the `find'
  command. This allows you to obtain a list of items that have got a
  given keyword attached to them. For example, to get a list of items
  which have something to do with COSINE, use the following command:
  <xmp>
    start
    find COSINE
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  You will be sent a list of everything that CONCISE can find which
  is to do with COSINE. There is no need to do a `goto' command before
  `find' as it will search everywhere.
  <p>
    The word that you put after `find' is called a keyword. To find out
    what keywords you can use, the `keywords' command can be sent:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    start
    keywords
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  This will return a list of all the keywords that CONCISE knows about.</div>
