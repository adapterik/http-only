  <h1>Priviliged ports</h1>
  The TCP/IP port numbers below 1024 are special in that normal users
  are not  allowed to run servers on them.  This is a security feaure,
  in that if you connect to a service on one of these ports you are
  fairly sure that you have the real thing, and not a fake which some
  hacker has put up for you.
  <p>
    The normal port number for W3 servers is port 80, which is such a
    port. (This number is assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,
    IANA).</p>
  <p>
    When you run a server as a test from a non-priviliged account, you
    will normally test it on other ports, such as 2784 or 5000 typically.
  </p>
  <h2>Under unix</h2>
  The inet daemon (running as root) can listen for incomming conections
  on port 80 and pass them down to a process with a safer uid for the
  server itself. Of course, you have to be root to <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/735" original-href="Installation.html" archive-page-id="735">set up the inet daemon</a>.
  <h2>Under VMS </h2>
  Under UCX, The process running as a server needs BYPASS privilege
  to listen to ports below 1024.  This might mean you have to install
  the server.  With other TCP/IP packages, privilege of some sort is
  similarly required.
