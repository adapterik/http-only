  There are a number of ways of accessing the data one is looking for.
  Navigational access (i.e., following links) is the essence of hypertext,
  but this can be enhanced with a number of facilities to make life
  more efficient and less confusing.
  <h2>Defined structure</h2>
  It is sometimes nice for a reader to be able to reference a document
  structure built specifically to enhance his understanding, by the
  document author. This is especially important when the structure is
  part of the information the author wishes to convery.
  <p>
    See a <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/939" original-href="../../Conferences/ECHT90/Structured.html" archive-page-id="939">separate discussion of this point</a> .
  </p>
  <h2><a name="6">Graphic Overview</a></h2>
  A Graphic overview  is useful and could be built automatically. Should
  it be made by the author, server, browser or an independent daemon?
  <p>
    Can one provide an overview with less granularity than the basic web
    by grouping nodes in some way?  The user could select from <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/233" original-href="Topology.html#4" archive-page-id="233">link types</a>
    used to imply the tree structure. <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/24" original-href="../People.html#groff" archive-page-id="24">(JFG)</a></p>
  <p>
    I think this depends on how long it will take. It might be interesting
    to experiment with daemons which will independently make and update
    maps of the web. This is not essential for a first pilot model.
  </p>
  <h2>History mechanism</h2>
  This allows users to retrace their steps. Typical functions provided
  can be interpreted in a hypertext web as follows:
  <dl>
    <dt>Home
    </dt>
    <dd> Go to initial node
    </dd>
    <dt>Back
    </dt>
    <dd> Go to the node visited before this one in chronological order.
      Modify the history to remove the current node.
    </dd>
    <dt>Next
    </dt>
    <dd> When the current node is one of several nodes linked to the ªbackº
      node, go to the next of those nodes. Leave the ªBackº node unchanged.
      Modify the history to remove the current node and replace it with
      the "next" (new current) node.
    </dd>
    <dt>Previous
    </dt>
    <dd> When the current node is one of several nodes linked to the
      ªbackº node, go to the preceding one of those nodes.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  In many hypertext systems, a tree structure is forcibly imposed on
  the data, and these functions are interpreted only with respect to
  the links in the tree. However, the reader as he browses defines a
  tree, and it may be more relevant to him to use that tree as a basis
  for these functions. I would therefore suggest that an explicit tree
  structure not be enforced. 
  <p>
    (If a default tree is needed by the system for some reason, then we
    can always use the creation order: when a node is created it is always
    created with a link to an existing node. Such links, whatever their
    type, may be used to define a tree. If they are deleted, an alternative
    link must be chosen to become a tree link.) </p>
  <p>
    If authors want to write a tree structure into their documents, then
    the words "after", "before" and "above" could be used to mean a static
    structure. 
  </p>
  <h2><a name="8">Index</a></h2>
  An Index helps new readers of a large database quickly find an obscure
  node. Keyword schemes I include in the general topic of indexes. <a name="9">The
    index must, like a graphic overview, be built either by the author,
    or automatically by one of the server, browser, or a daemon</a>.   The
  index entries may be taken from the titles, a keyword list, or the
  node content  or a combination of these. Note that keywords, if they
  are specifically created rather than random words, map onto hypertext
  ªconceptº nodes, or nodes of special type ªkeywordº. It is interesting
  to establish an identity relationship between keywords in two different
  databases -- this may lead a searcher from one database into another.
  <p>
    Index schemes are important  but  indexes or keywords should look
    like normal hypertext nodes.  The particular special operation one
    can do with a good keyword index system which one can't do with a
    normal hypertext system is to do a fast search on multiple keywords.
    This must to be provided as an extension to the hypertext navigation
    scheme. However, it is in fact analogous to a trace starting with
    more than one node, which is a valid hypertext tracing operation.
    The difference is that the tracing would normally be done by a browser,
    but the indexed search done by the server.</p>
  <p>
    When many nodes in a web represent different indexes, then a query
    search can chain between them (See "<a name="7" href="/archive/cern/940" original-href="ManyIndexes.html" archive-page-id="940"> Web of indexes</a> ").</p>

  </p>
  <h2>Node Names</h2>
  These allow faster access if one knows the name. They allow people
  to give references to hypertext nodes in other documents, over the
  telephone, etc. This is very useful. However,  in Notecards, where
  the naming of nodes was enforced, it was found that thinking up names
  for nodes was a bore for users. KMS thought that being able to jump
  to a named node was important. The node name allows a command line
  interface to be used to add new nodes.
  <p>
    I think that naming a node should be optional: perhaps by default
    the system could provide a number which can be used instead of a name.The
    system should certainly support the naming of nodes, and access by
    name.
  </p>
  <h2>Menu of links</h2>
  Regular linkwise navigation may be done with ªhotspotsº (highlighted
  anchors) or may be done with a menu. It may be useful to have a menu
  of all the links from a given node as an alternative way of navigating.
  Enquire, for example, offers a menu of references as the only way
  of navigating.</div>
