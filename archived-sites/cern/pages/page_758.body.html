  <h1>VMS Help server Bugs</h1>
  This is a list of known bugs and desired improvements. Don't let it shrink too
  fast : send your bug reports and suggestions to
  <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/24" original-href="../People.html#groff" archive-page-id="24">Jean-Francois Groff</a> (jfg@cernvax.cern.ch).
  <ul>
    <li>The keyword search works fine on any number of levels down, but then the
      generic daemon doesn't know how deep the server went, so anchor names lack the
      intermediate levels. Solution : generate anchor names relative to the input path
      (before '?').
    </li>
    <li>DANGER : Attempts to access VMS topics with a weird name like ":=" will
      crash the server because VMS will try to create a .HLP file with an invalid file
      specification due to these special characters. Solution : Make a good escaping
      system (that works with VMS and Un*x styles as well). Crude and bulletproof
      solution : Ignore any offending topic name !
    </li>
    <li>Reference to another help library through @ will only search SYS$HELP
      for the corresponding .HLB file.
    </li>
    <li>We need an overview page that lists all help libraries available.
    </li>
  </ul>
