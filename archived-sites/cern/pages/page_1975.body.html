  <h1>MAILBASE COMMANDS</h1>
  Mailbase responds to commands sent as electronic mail messages to
  the address 'mailbase@uk.ac.newcastle'
  <p>
    It is *important* that commands be sent *only* to this address! Do
    not send commands to any of the mail distribution lists (for example,
    the lis-it list mentioned above) which are managed by Mailbase.</p>
  <p>
    Commands sent to Mailbase are executed in sequence until a terminator,
    or an error, is found.  A mail message reporting success or failure
    is then returned to you.  More than one command may appear in any
    one mail message to Mailbase, but each command must be on a separate
    line. Except when stated otherwise, commands may appear in any order,
    and they may be in UPPER, lower, or MiXeD case.</p>
  <p>
    Problems or queries relating to Mailbase commands should be sent
    as an electronic mail message to 'mailbase-request@uk.ac.newcastle'
    (see "<a name="1" href="/archive/cern/1973" original-href="Addresses.html" archive-page-id="1973">Addresses</a>").</p>
  <p>
    The Mailbase commands are:</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <xmp>   help                           review </xmp>
  <pre><listname>
   describe </listname><commandname>         send </commandname><listname> </listname><filename>
   index [</filename><listname>]             statistics [command | list]
   line-limit </listname><number>            stop
   listme                         subscribe </number><listname> </listname><firstname> </firstname><lastname>
   lists [full]                   unsubscribe </lastname><listname>
 
</listname></pre>
  These are described in full below, and also in the Mailbase Reference
  <p>
    Card.
  </p>

  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.1 Getting Help from Mailbase</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  If you already use Mailbase (by being a member of a list), sending
  an electronic mail message containing the command help to Mailbase
  will result in a brief summary of Mailbase commands being sent to
  you by return.  If you do not already use Mailbase, the help command
  will send you a copy of this, the User Guide.
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  If you already use Mailbase and you wish to obtain a copy of this
  User Guide by electronic mail, send this command to Mailbase
  <xmp>
    send mailbase userhelp
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Information about a specific command may be retrieved by sending a
  'describe' command.
  <p>
    For example, sending the command 'describe describe' to Mailbase
    will result in the following message being sent to you
  </p>
  <xmp>
    Name:      describe
    Example:   describe subscribe
    Syntax:    describe command
    Description:   This command gives a description of individual Mailbase
    commands. The word "describe"  may be abbreviated to "des".
    See also:   "help"
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Problems or queries that require human intervention should be addressed
  to mailbase-request@uk.ac.newcastle
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.2 Information on Current Discussions</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  To find out the names of the discussion lists currently managed by
  Mailbase, send the command 'lists' or 'lists full'.  The command alone
  will return a list of all the current Mailbase discussion lists; the
  option 'full' adds a short description of each one.
  <p>
    More detailed information about an individual list may be obtained
    by sending a 'review' command.  For example,
  </p>
  <xmp>
    review lis-it
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  returns the names of owners and members of the list, a brief description
  of the list's purpose and details about its access facilities, which
  are marked 'yes' if they are available to non-members and 'no' if
  not. These are:
  <dl>
    <dt>Subscribe direct:
    </dt>
    <dd> If 'no', non-members must send an e-mail message
      to the list owner, asking to be added to the list.
    </dd>
    <dt> Contribute mail:
    </dt>
    <dd> If 'no', you must join the list before sending mail
      to it.
    </dd>
    <dt> Request review:
    </dt>
    <dd> If 'no', you must join the list in order to request
      review information.
    </dd>
    <dt> Request files:
    </dt>
    <dd> If 'no', you must join the list in order to retrieve
      any files which are associated with it.
    </dd>
    <dt> Archive:
    </dt>
    <dd> If 'no', list contributions are not stored in an archive
      file.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.3 Subscribing to Discussions</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Note: 'subscribe' is the name chosen for the command: it does not
  mean that you have to pay a subscription fee!
  <p>
    If the list you wish to join is open for direct subscription, send
    the following command to Mailbase
  </p>
  <xmp>
    subscribe </xmp>
  <pre><listname> </listname><firstname> </firstname><surname>
 
</surname></pre>
  For example,
  <xmp>
    subscribe lis-it Fred Smith
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  would add your name (Fred Smith) and mail address (taken from your
  message header) to the lis-it discussion list.
  <p>
    If the list you wish to use is closed for direct subscription, you
    will be asked to send a message to
  </p>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre><listname>-request@uk.ac.newcastle
 
</listname></pre>
  (where listname is the chosen list).  For example: lis-it-request@uk.ac.newcastle
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.4 Checking your Membership of Discussion Lists</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  To obtain a list of the discussion lists of which you are a member,
  send the following command to Mailbase
  <xmp>
    listme
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.5 Leaving Discussions</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  To leave a discussion list, send an 'unsubscribe' command to Mailbase.
  For example,
  <xmp>
    unsubscribe lis-it
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  would remove your name from the lis-it list.
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.6 Retrieving Files via Electronic Mail</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Many discussion lists have files associated with them.  To find out
  which lists these are, send the following command to Mailbase
  <xmp>
    index
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  To find out what files are associated with a particular list, attach
  the list name to the command.  For example,
  <xmp>
    index lis-it
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  will tell you which files are associated with the lis-it list. The
  index contains information about the size of files.  The files themselves
  may be retrieved with the command
  <xmp>
    send </xmp>
  <pre><listname> </listname><filename>
 
</filename></pre>
  For example,
  <xmp>
    send lis-it 12-1990
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  will retrieve the file called 12-1990 (the archive file containing
  all contributions sent to this list during December 1990) which belongs
  to the lis-it list.  We recommend that you retrieve and read some
  archive files before you start contributing to discussions.
  <p>
    If a file is larger than 100,000 characters (approximately 5000 lines),
    it may be necessary to retrieve it in several pieces.  Do this by
    preceding the send command with a 'line-limit' command. For example,
  </p>
  <xmp>
    line-limit 2000
    send nisp assess.txt
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  would retrieve the file 'assess.txt', associated with the  nisp  list,
  in the form of several pieces, each containing a maximum of 2000 lines.
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.7 Information on Use of Mailbase</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  To obtain some statistical information about the use which has been
  made of Mailbase, use the statistics command, which has the form
  <xmp>
    statistics [ command | list ]
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  The 'command' option gives statistics about commands and 'list' about
  lists. If no options are given you will receive both command and list
  information.
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>2.8 Mail with Signatures</h2>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  If your electronic mail messages end with a signature, terminate your
  Mailbase commands with the command
  <xmp>
    stop
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  This prevents Mailbase from attempting to interpret your signature
  as a series of commands.
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
