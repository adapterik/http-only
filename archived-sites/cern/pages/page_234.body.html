  <h1>Versioning</h1>
  Definition: The storage and management of previous copies of a piece
  of information, for security, diagnostics, and interest.

    Do you want version control?</p>
  <p>
    Can you reference a version only?</p>
  <p>
    If you refer to a particular place in a node, how does one follow
    it in a new version, if that place ceases to exist?</p>

    Yes, at CERN we will want versioning. Very often one wants to correct
    a news item, even one of limited life, without reissuing it. This
    is a problem with VAX/NOTES for example. I would suggest that the
    text for the current version is stored, and separately those modifications
    necessary to backtrack to previous versions. I would expect previous
    versions to be regenerated only on the fly, as needed. (Apparaently
    SCCS stores the original file and the differences. This system does
    allow you to ditsribute the differences when updating copies.)</p>
  <p>
    If full differences (deltas) are kept, the first version is just the
    first delta from a null document. The latest version is not available
    without regenerating it from all the deltas.  For speed, it is obviously
    useful to <a name="3">keep a copy</a> of the latest version  (see <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/853" original-href="Caching.html" archive-page-id="853">caching</a> ).</p>
  <p>
    Versioning is necessary for accountability  (--David Durand, dgd@cs.bu.edu).
    If an author is to be accountable for information published, it should
    be possible to demonstrate later what he wrote, even if he has later
    changed it.</p>
  <p>
    A WWW server may provide versioning, by allowing links between a document
    version and its previou and succesive versions. This would be a good
    use of <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/852" original-href="LinkTypes.html#1" archive-page-id="852">link typing</a> .</p>
  <p>
    Keeping track of versions allows one solution to the <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/943" original-href="Annotation.html" archive-page-id="943">annotation problem</a>.</p>
