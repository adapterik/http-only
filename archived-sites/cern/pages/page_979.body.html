  <h2><a name="architecture">Architecture</a></h2>
  The conclusion of this talk was the presentation of a software architecture for the next generation of hypertext systems. This differed in some ways from the WorldWideWeb architecture, and was therefore interesting. The architecure was designed to handle Inter-network hypermedia ("an up-and-coming area of research"). The model was that:-
  <ul>
    <li>The operating system should include link services which all applications will be encouraged to use, so that inter-application jumps will be possible.
    </li>
    <li>The link information will be stored separately from the documents in a database in each filesystem.
    </li>
    <li>Details of each link will be stored by both the source and destination link servers.
    </li>
    <li>There will be a common file system which will allow remote applications to access the document when they follow a link.
    </li>
    <li>There will be common document formats, so that common access to files is all that is needed for document interchange.
    </li>
  </ul>
