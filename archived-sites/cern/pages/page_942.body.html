  <h1>Tracing Links</h1>
  A form of search in a hypertext base involves tracing the links between
  given nodes. For example, to find a module suitable for connecting
  a decstation to SCSI, one might try finding paths between a document
  on decstations and a document on SCSI. This is similar to relevance
  feedback in index searching.
  <p>
    Tracing is made more powerful by using <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/233" original-href="Topology.html#4" archive-page-id="233">typed links</a>. In that case,
    one could perform semantic searches for all document written by people
    who were part of the same organisation as the author of this one,
    for example. This can use node typing as well. </p>
  <p>
    When using link tracing,  documents take over from keywords.</p>
