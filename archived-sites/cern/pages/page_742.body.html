  <h1>Library bugs and wishes</h1>
  These are things which need to be fixed or would be useful if added
  in the W3 common code library. See also a list of<a name="0" href="/archive/cern/743" original-href="Features.html" archive-page-id="743"> features added and
    bugs fixed.</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Add rcp access to the "file" access method if it is straightforward.
      The rcp protocol was originally defined by the UCB code, and still
      is perhaps best defined that way. More recent retrospctive documentation
      exists (where?)
    </li>
    <li>Add code to save back files by HTTP or FTP, and code to REGENERATE
      HTML from a styled hypertext.
    </li>
    <li>In each protocol access module, put timeouts on both connect() and
      read() using non-blocking mode and select() to allow user-defined
      covering timeouts for document retrieval. A little common code here
      would be useful, allowing also platform-dependent "Abort" buttons
      on long transfers.
    </li>
    <li>Library version number for diagnostic output by programs
    </li>
    <li>Makefile -- complete dependencies
    </li>
  </ul>
