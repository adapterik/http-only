  <h1>Installation</h1>
  Here are the steps necessary to install the <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/21" original-href="Overview.html" archive-page-id="21">Mail Robot</a> product on
  your unix system.
  <h2>Customisation</h2>
  Set up the variables in <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/833" original-href="Implementation/listserv.h" archive-page-id="833">listserv.h</a> and <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/834" original-href="Implementation/CommonMakefile" archive-page-id="834">CommonMakefile</a> to suit your
  site.
  <dl>
    <dt>POSTMASTER
    </dt>
    <dd> The address from which messages appear to come. Why not
      listserv? Perhaps to prevent mail loops.
    </dd>
    <dt>SECUREWWW
    </dt>
    <dd> The executable W3 line mode browser (v1.3 or later, so as
      to have the -listrefs option). This is a separate product. For security,
      www should be writable only by root.
    </dd>
    <dt>SERVERDIR
    </dt>
    <dd> The directory in which you want to put your mailing lists
      and help about them.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Compile the programs</h2>
  Everything compiled on AEM's MicroVax II running ULTRIX 3.0 then TBL's
  NeXT without any problem at all. Your results may vary.
  <h2>Create your SERVDIR</h2>
  wherever you specified in listserv.h. Install a HELP file, perhaps
  using the example-files/HELP in this directory as a template.
  <h2>Set up an alias "listserv"</h2>
  Make an alias in your /etc/aliases (or /etc/sendmail/aliases, whatever
  you have) that points to this program, for example:
  <xmp>
    listserv:	"|/usr/local/mail/listserv"
    robot:		"|/usr/local/mail/listserv"
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>For each mailing list</h2>
  Create a name.info file giving a bit of information about that mailing
  list. see the *.info files in the example-files subdirectory.
  <p>
    Create a name file in the same directory, consisting of email addresses
    one to a line of subscribers to a group. If it is for a brand-new
    group, create an empty file. Remember that this file must be writable
    by the mail daemon. The name of the file is just the name of the group.</p>
  <p>
    Depending on how you have your mailing lists set up, you may need
    to add an alias to the /etc/aliases file for each of the mailing lists.
    For example:
  </p>
  <xmp>	real-recipes: :include:/usr/local/mail/maillists/recipes
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  So sending mail to real-recipes actually goes to each of the subscribers
  listed in /usr/local/mail/maillists/recipes
  <h2>Install listserv</h2>
  Install in the appropriate directory.  Edit the CommonMakefile and
  then
  <xmp>		make install
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>Run newaliases</h2>
  This gets sendmail to read the changes in /etc/aliases.
  <xmp>		newaliases
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>Try it out</h2>
  Send mail to listserv with body
  <xmp>
    HELP
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  for example.</div>
