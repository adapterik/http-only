  <h1>Recommended HTML Usage</h1>
  This part of <a href="/archive/cern/294" original-href="MarkUp.html" archive-page-id="294">the HTML Reference</a> shows
  recommended usage. These constructs are recommended because
  <ul>
    <li>They conform to the SGML definition of HTML
    </li>
    <li>They are straightforward to implement
    </li>
    <li>They work on most existing browsers
    </li>
  </ul>
  This section contains many suggestions, rules of thumb, and the like.
  Where the suggestions are not equivalent to <a name="id1" href="/archive/cern/1067" original-href="html.dtd" archive-page-id="1067">the DTD</a>, the words "should," "may," etc. are
  linked to futher explanation.
  <h2>Structure of an HTML document</h2>
  An HTML document <a name="id2" href="/archive/cern/1070" original-href="complete.html#structure" archive-page-id="1070">should</a>
  start with a <a href="#TITLE">TITLE element</a>.
  <p>
    If the document is searchable, an <a name="id3" href="#ISINDEX">ISINDEX</a> element should come next.</p>
  <p>
    After any TITLE and ISINDEX elements comes the BODY, which <a name="id4" href="/archive/cern/1071" original-href="tolerated.html#id1" archive-page-id="1071">should</a> start with an H1 element,
    followed by other elements character data.</p>
  <p>
    See also: <a name="id13" href="/archive/cern/1071" original-href="tolerated.html#structure" archive-page-id="1071">tolerated
      structural errors</a>, <a name="id14" href="/archive/cern/1073" original-href="errors.html#structure" archive-page-id="1073">severe structural errors</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Header Elements</h2>
  <h3><a name="TITLE">TITLE</a></h3>
  The TITLE element should identify the document in a fairly wide
  context. Its content should fit on one line: it should be less than 72
  characters with no linebreaks. It <a name="id5" href="/archive/cern/1070" original-href="complete.html#TITLE" archive-page-id="1070">should
  </a>
  not contain any '&lt;' characters.
  <p>
    The title may be used to identify the node in a history list, to label
    the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally displayed in
    the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with <a href="#headings">headings </a>.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="ISINDEX">ISINDEX</a></h3>
  The presence of the ISINDEX element indicates the document is
  searchable.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>Body Elements</h2>
  Within the content of these elements, the characters '&lt;', '&gt;',
  and '&amp;' signal markup <a name="id12" href="/archive/cern/1068" original-href="Text.html#PCDATA" archive-page-id="1068">in many
    cases</a>. They <a name="id6" href="/archive/cern/1075" original-href="supported.html#delimiters" archive-page-id="1075">should
  </a>
  be written as "&amp;lt;", "&amp;gt;", and "&amp;amp;" respectively, to
  prevent this.
  <h3>Anchors</h3>
  A span of text can be marked as an anchor. Anchors can be used as the
  source of a hypertext link:
  <p>
    Choose <a href="/archive/cern/1071" original-href="tolerated.html" archive-page-id="1071">this</a> to view a neighbor
    document.</p>
  <p>
    ... or as the destination: </p>
  <p>
    <a name="Fred">Fred Flinstone</a></p>
  <p>

      anchors</a>, <a name="id16" href="/archive/cern/1073" original-href="errors.html#a" archive-page-id="1073">severe errors in
      anchors</a>.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="headings">Headings</a></h3>
  Headings are used to break the body into sections and subsections.
  Several levels of headings are defined: 
  <p>
  </p>
  <h4>Level four headings are for sub-sub-sub headings</h4>
  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
  Text that isn't marked up as some other element forms a paragraph.
  <p>
    Normal paragraphs consist of text consisting of words, sentences, and
    other stuff. Line breaks have no significance except to separate words.
    This is still the first
    paragraph of this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the second paragraph. Paragraphs are separated by P elements.
    HTML is relatively flat, and paragraph breaks are not allowed inside
    lists, headers, anchors, etc.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>Lists</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the first item of an unordered list.
    </li>
    <li>This is the
      second item. It's kinda long, and should wrap around on most screens.
    </li>
    <li>This is the third item. It's only one paragraph, but it's got a
      paragraph tag at the end.
    </li>
    <li>This is the fourth and final item.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Glossaries</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>term </dt>
    <dd> definition 
    </dd>
    <dt>another term </dt>
    <dd> and its definition, which is long enough that it
      should wrap around on most screens.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Address</h3>
  The address element indicates the author or source of the document:
  <p>
  </p>
  <address>DWC
    connolly@convex.com</address>
  <h3>TYPEWRITER</h3>
  The TYPEWRITER element is used for characters that have already been
  formatted for a typewriter-like device. Markup is recognized in this
  element just as in the normal body paragraphs. But after processing tags
  and entity references, the data is displayed as on a typewriter,
  rather than using typesetting conventions.
  <p>
    Line breaks are significant, and characters are rendered in a
    fixed-width font to preserve horizontal formatting.</p>
  <p>
    For example, a portion of a man page might look like:</p>
  <p>
    <typewriter>
      NOTES
      cat is able to correctly access files larger that two giga-
      bytes in size.

  <h2>Literal Text Elements</h2>
  <h3>XMP and LISTING</h3>
  These elements are used when you want to type the characters into the
  source document and have them show up in the output just like you
  typed them.
  <p>
    These elements act much like the TYPEWRITER element, but because
    markup is not recognized in their content, some character sequences
    can't be represented (SGML end tags, for example.) On the other
    hand, you don't have to meticulously mark up all the special characters.
  </p>
  <xmp>
    You can draw pictures    /\
    in example elements    /  \
    see:                \__/
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <xmp>This is literal text. THIS word
    should line up under  THIS word.
    There should be exactly three blank lines between here
    and here.
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  These elements are the source of the most errors in HTML
  implementations. They should be used only for simple examples that
  don't contiain SGML markup constructs.
