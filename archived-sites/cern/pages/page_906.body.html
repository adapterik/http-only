  <h1>Poster preparation</h1>
  Hypertext'91 is fast approaching, and several of the technical program
  <p>
    committee have commented to me about the high quality of the poster</p>
  <p>
    technical track.  I am looking forward to meeting all of you,</p>
  <p>
    but to be realistic, I will probably be nervous when we do meet.</p>
  <p>
    I have structured the "final" instructions for poster presenters in
    a</p>
  <p>
    question and answer format (Q&amp;A).  If you have any further questions,</p>
  <p>
    do not hesitate to contact me.  If I get some questions that are of
    general</p>
  <p>
    interest, then I may distribute another Q&amp;A list.</p>
  <p>
    For those of you who have received such a list before,</p>
  <p>
    I suggest that you start reading at the end of this message</p>
  <p>
    to see what is new.</p>
  <p>
    I have added some poster preparation guidelines.</p>

    Q:	When will the posters be displayed?</p>
  <p>
    A:	Posters will be displayed almost all the time during the conference.</p>
  <p>
    Posters will be set up on Monday between 12:30 and 3:00pm,</p>
  <p>
    and the posters will be open for viewing shortly thereafter.</p>
  <p>
    There will be a 2.5-hour block of time dedicated to the</p>
  <p>
    posters and demonstrations during Monday and Tuesday evenings.</p>
  <p>
    Poster presenters will be expected to have someone available</p>
  <p>
    to answer questions during those periods,</p>
  <p>
    although it would be useful to be available at other times.</p>
  <p>
    Q:	Will the posters be published as part of the proceedings?</p>
  <p>
    A:	No, but abstracts of the posters will be available at the conference.</p>
  <p>
    Posters will be technical "presentations" but not "publications".</p>
  <p>
    Some posters might make good papers for the SIGLINK newsletter,</p>
  <p>
    or other outlets.</p>
  <p>
    Q:	How many posters were accepted?</p>
  <p>
    A:	To maintain high quality, only 22 posters were accepted.</p>
  <p>
    Q:	How will the posters be displayed?</p>
  <p>
    A:	Two large meeting rooms have been reserved in the conference hotel.</p>
  <p>
    The conference committee and the posters chair have taken special</p>
  <p>
    care to provide ample room for people to walk through the posters.</p>
  <p>
    Each poster will be provided with a tack-board, table, and chair.</p>
  <p>
    tack board:  8' x 4' (2.44 m x 1.22 m)</p>
  <p>
    table:       8 x 15" (2.44 m x 0.38 m)</p>
  <p>
    chair:       4 legs (.004 kilolegs)</p>
  <p>
    Pushpins will be provided, but electrical outlets will not.</p>
  <p>
    Q:	Should we bring printed papers/articles?</p>
  <p>
    A:	It is a good idea to bring a printed summary of your work</p>
  <p>
    for people to pick up.  Preprints have a tendency to disappear</p>
  <p>
    in large numbers.  I suggest you bring about 200, and that</p>
  <p>
    you put them out in stages.  Consider bringing an extended</p>
  <p>
    abstract on a single page instead of a full paper.</p>
  <p>
    A similar number of business cards might also be useful,</p>
  <p>
    but you can put contact information on your paper.</p>
  <p>
    Keep a signup sheet on your table to get the names of people</p>
  <p>
    who were interested in your work.  Place a box for their cards.</p>
  <p>
    Q:	Do you have any poster preparation guidelines?</p>
  <p>
    A:	A poster presentation should be self-contained and require no</p>
  <p>
    explanation, although it is useful for the presenter to be</p>
  <p>
    available for questions and discussion.  The basic parts of a poster</p>
  <p>
    are the title banner and the body.  The title banner is important</p>
  <p>
    because it may be what attracts people wandering through the room.</p>
  <p>
    Title banners should list the poster title and the author names</p>
  <p>
    and affiliations.  Title banner lettering should be legible</p>
  <p>
    from at least five yards/metres away, so we recommend lettering</p>
  <p>
    of 1 inch / 2.5 cm.  We recommend that you use almost the full width</p>
  <p>
    of the poster board (leave 4 inches / 10 cm on the right for poster</p>
  <p>
    identification numbers that we will be providing).</p>
  <p>
    The body of the poster should be legible from 2 yards/metres away.</p>
  <p>
    The layout should allow a person to read from left to right,</p>
  <p>
    without having to backtrack, which can be difficult in a crowd.</p>
  <p>
    Therefore, for a poster with 8 panels, we recommend a layout like:</p>
  <p>
    1	3	5	7</p>
  <p>
    2	4	6	8</p>
  <p>
    over a layout like:</p>
  <p>
    1	2	3	4</p>
  <p>
    5	6	7	8</p>
  <p>
    In any case, we recommend that you attach large numbers to each panel</p>
  <p>
    to clarify the order of reading.</p>
  <p>
    You should preview your poster before the meeting.  Ask colleagues</p>
  <p>
    unfamiliar with the work to view the poster and give you feedback.</p>
  <p>
    Although in an ideal world people would focus on content, the format</p>
  <p>
    of a poster is often critical for it to get approached and read.</p>
  <p>
    Use high-quality print (e.g., large laser printer fonts) and consider</p>
  <p>
    using color.  The background of the tack boards is dull; I like to</p>
  <p>
    bring light colored paper to completely cover the board before putting</p>
  <p>
    up a poster.  You should consider putting extra time into making</p>
  <p>
    it easy to set up (and take down) your poster at the conference;</p>
  <p>
    this favors large panels, but remember that you will have to travel</p>
  <p>
    on a plane with your poster.</p>
  <p>
    Final setup instructions will be available at the conference.</p>
  <p>
    We will provide pushpins to put up your posters (do not write</p>
  <p>
    or paint on the tack boards), but I recommend that you</p>
  <p>
    bring your own materials; if we do run out, then you do not want</p>
  <p>
    to be the person who is delayed.  I always bring tape and scissors</p>
  <p>
    and pens, even when I am told these will be available.
