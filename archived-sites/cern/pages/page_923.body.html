  <h1>A security system</h1>
  I could demonstrate the following components of the Complete Security
  System:
  <ul>
    <li>The Library of security mechanisms and services (containing: modules
      for math, operations with large numbers, four Message Authentication
      Codes, two symmetric encryption algorithms (DES and FEAL), two public-key
      algorithms (RSA and ElGamal), and zero knowledge authentication protocol).
    </li>
    <li>The complete multiuser secure station (based on PC, Macintosh or UNIX)
      station with all five ISO/OSI security services and with some additional
      secusty services.
    </li>
    <li>Indication of the LAN and WAN security system (by simulation), since
      there will be no network for the demo.
    </li>
    <li>Operations (simulation) of the complete comprehensive transparent
      security server.
    </li>
    <li>Applications of the Smart Cards Technologies.
    </li>
  </ul>
