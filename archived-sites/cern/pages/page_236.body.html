  <h1>Network Services Conference 1992 </h1>
  <address>Pisa, Italy, November 3-5, 1992
  </address>
  The world of  academic and research networking has evolved  to the
  point where  the  protocol  wars  have  become  largely  irrelevant.
  This  is demonstrated  by the  recent appearance  of high-level 
  networking tools which  are worldwide  in scope  and which  run simultaneously
  over many different lower layers. 
  <p>
    NSC 92  will focus on  issues in  providing services to  customers,
    with special attention  paid to the  recent and exciting developments
    in new global high-level tools such as  World-Wide Web, Prospero,
    Archie, Alex, Gopher, and WAIS. We will address the  impact of the
    new global tools on service development and  support, the  changing
    function  of traditional tools and services  (such as archives), upcoming
    specific services such as new  databases, and the future  role of
    the library.  User support at the campus level, and the role  of support
    in accessing global services, will be addressed. </p>
  <p>
    The conference will be of greatest interest to network service providers
    and sophisticated users  who are changing their focus  from providing
    or obtaining  bandwidth  to  offering,  supporting, and  using  varied
    and powerful services.  Talks and  other conference activities  will
    address the  needs   of  the  research,  academic,   educational,
    governmental, industrial, and commercial network communities. </p>
  <p>
    NSC 92  is being  organized by EARN  in conjunction  with EUnet/EurOpen,
    NORDUnet, RARE, and RIPE.
