  <h1>About Gopher:</h1>
  The Internet Gopher is a distributed document delivery service. It
  allows a neophyte user to access various types of data residing on
  multiple hosts in a seamless fashion.  This is accomplished by presenting
  the user a hierarchical arrangement of documents and by using a client-server
  communications model. In addition to browsing through hierarchies
  of documents, gopher users can submit queries to gopher search servers.
  The search servers typically have full-text indexes for a set of gopher
  documents; the responce to a query is a list of documents that matched
  the search criteria.
  <p>
    Internet Gopher servers accept simple queries (sent over a TCP connection),
    and respond by sending the client a document or a list of documents.
    Since this is a distributed protocol there can be many servers...
    but the client software hides this fact from the user. We currently
    use this technology at the University of Minnesota to help support
    microcomputer users... a couple of gopher servers have 6000-7000 computer
    Q&amp;A items that users can search for answers to their questions. In
    addition, there are also gopher servers with recipes and other fun
    stuff.</p>
  <p>
    The PC Gopher client runs on most networked PCs, but requires that
    you have loaded the appropriate Clarkson packet driver for your network
    ethernet card. The PC gopher software has a TurboVision user interface
    so both keyboard and mouse are supported... and you don't need to
    run MS Windows.</p>
  <p>
    If you want more information about the Gopher protocol, you can anonymous
    FTP to boombox.micro.umn.edu and look in the /pub/gopher directory
    tree. Currently there are gopher clients for Mac, PC and Unix (curses-based)
    available from the University of Minnesota. The University of St.
    Thomas wrote a NeXT gopher client available for anonymous ftp from
    cs.stthomas.edu (140.209.5.1) directory gopher, file Gopher_1.0b.tar.Z
    (51605 bytes).</p>
  <p>
    Note that you can also access the gopher system via telnet sessions
    to consultnat.micro.umn.edu (log in as "gopher").</p>
