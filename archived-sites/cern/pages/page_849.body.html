  <h1>Intended Uses</h1>
  Here are some of the many areas in which hypertext is used. Each area
  has its specific requirements in the way of features required. 
  <ul>
    <li>General reference data - encyclopaedia, etc.
    </li>
    <li>Completely centralized publishing - online help, documentation, tutorial
      etc
    </li>
    <li>More or less centralized dissemination of news which has a limited
      life
    </li>
    <li>Collaborative authoring 
    </li>
    <li>Collaborative design of something other than the hypertext itself
    </li>
    <li>Personal notebook
    </li>
  </ul>
  The CERN requirement has a mixture of many of these uses, except that
  there is not a requirement for distribution of fixed hypertext on
  hard media such as optical disk. Evidently, the system will have to
  be networked, though databases may start life at least as personal
  notebooks.
  <p>
    For looking up data bases, the user should be able to refer to already
    prepared complex queries by simple UDIs. A moe advanced user should
    also be able to prepare a complex query himself, store it (interpreted
    language!) in his local filing space, and use it through a simple
    UDI.</p>

    [The (paper) document "HyperText and CERN" describes the problem to
    be solved at CERN, and the requirements of a system which solves them.
    That information is not repeated here.]</p>
