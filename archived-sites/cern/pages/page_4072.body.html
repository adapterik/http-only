  <h1>Output Keywords</h1>
  This last class of keywords controls how WHOIS displays the results
  of a search.  They are: 
  <dl>
    <dt>EXPand or '*' 
    </dt>
    <dd> Tells WHOIS to always expand the long display for
      a single  match to include all the subdisplays, without  asking you,
      the user, if you wish to see them or not. 
    </dd>
    <dt> '~'
    </dt>
    <dd> This one doesn't even have a keyword, just the magic character
      equivalent.  It is the opposite of '*' and says not to show any subdisplays
      at all, period. 
    </dd>
    <dt>Full
    </dt>
    <dd> Gives a long display for EACH matching record, not just when
      there's only a single match. 
    </dd>
    <dt>SUMmary
    </dt>
    <dd> For completeness, this always gives a summary line for each
      match, even if there's only one. 
    </dd>
    <dt>SUBdisplay or '%' 
    </dt>
    <dd> Shows the subdisplay for the matching record following
      a  summary line for the record itself.  See the section "<a name="1" href="/archive/cern/4079" original-href="Subdisplays.html" archive-page-id="4079"> Subdisplays</a>
      " for details. 
    </dd>
  </dl>
