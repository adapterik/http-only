  <h1><a name="top">A Complete Set of Constructs</a></h1>
  The <a name="id1" href="/archive/cern/1069" original-href="recommended.html" archive-page-id="1069">recommended usage</a> is
  incomplete; it only includes those constructs that are easy to
  implement and explain. This section discusses a few more constructs
  that allow you to do anything that can legally be done. There are <a name="id2" href="/archive/cern/1075" original-href="supported.html" archive-page-id="1075">constructs beyond these</a>, but they
  can all be reduced to constructs shown here.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2><a name="structure">Document Structure</a></h2>
  An HTML document is a header part followed by a BODY element.
  <p>
    The header part consists of the TITLE, ISINDEX, and NEXTID elements
    which each appear zero or one time in any order. (see <a name="id3" href="/archive/cern/2006" original-href="structure1.html" archive-page-id="2006">ISINDEX test</a>, <a name="id5" href="/archive/cern/2007" original-href="structure2.html" archive-page-id="2007">no title test</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    The BODY start and end tags may be omitted. They will be inferred by
    SGML parsers. <a name="id4" href="/archive/cern/1069" original-href="recommended.html" archive-page-id="1069">"Recommended
      Usage"</a> is an example of this. This entity is an example of
    explicitly including the BODY tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PLAINTEXT tag signals the end of the HTML text entity, and
    the beginning of a non-SGML data entity. (The format of the data
    is governed by the MIME text/plain content type.)</p>

        structure</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Header Elements</h2>
  <h3><a name="TITLE">TITLE</a></h3>
  The title can have an '&lt;' character, as long as it's not followed
  by a '/' and a letter. See <a name="id10" href="/archive/cern/1068" original-href="Text.html#CDATA" archive-page-id="1068">the
    section on SGML delimiters in CDATA</a>.
  <h2>Body Elements</h2>
  The normal text content of body elements may include several kinds of
  markup.
  <p>
    A comment that you shouldn't see: <!-- Your implementation is broken
if you see this.--> For copyrights, RCS keywords, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    processing instruction: <?bold lkjsdf > If you've _got_ to
      stick TeX macros or something in there, use this. The sample
      implementation won't even tell you it's there, though.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Entity References</h3>
    Entity references are recognized in normal body elements (anyplace
    #PCDATA appears in the DTD) and attribute value literals.
    See <a name="id11" href="/archive/cern/1068" original-href="Text.html#Entities" archive-page-id="1068">the Entities section of
      "Text and Markup"</a> for more details.
    The HTML DTD defines the following entities for characters that might
    otherwise be parsed as markup:
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>HTML Entities</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Name
      </dt>
      <dd>Definition
      </dd>
      <dt>lt</dt>
      <dd>&lt;
      </dd>
      <dt>gt</dt>
      <dd>&gt;
      </dd>
      <dt>amp</dt>
      <dd>&amp;
      </dd>
      <dt>quot"</dt>
      <dd>"
      </dd>
      <dt>apos</dt>
      <dd>'
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>ISO Latin-1 Characters</h4>
    The HTML DTD references the public text
    "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN"
    to define entities for latin-1 characters, for example GÃ¶del was a
    famous mathemetician.
    <h2>Anchors</h2>
    <h3>Order and Apperance of Attributes</h3>
    <a href="#top">name implied</a>
    <p>
      <a name="xyz">HREF implied</a></p>
    <p>
      <a href="#top" name="xyz1">HREF before name</a></p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Quotes In Attribute Values</h3>
    In order to include quotes in the value of the content-type attribute,
    use "&amp;quot;" and "&amp;apos;" entity references:
    <a name="id13" href="/archive/cern/2011" content-type='application/x-tar; name="sgmls-0.8.tar"'>link
      to SGMLS software distribution with fancy content-type attribute</a>
    <h4>Note: Interpretation of Literals</h4>
    Section 7.9.3 of the SGML standard states
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An attribute value literal is interpreted as an attribute value by
        replacing references within it, ignoring Ee and RS, and replacing RE
        or SEPCHAR with SPACE.
      </li>
    </ul>
    For the SGML-impared, Ee is Entity End (like EOF); RS is '\n'; RE is
    '\r'; SEPCHAR is '\t' and SPACE is ' '.
    <p>
      Since to date there are no HTML attributes containing newlines or
      spaces, that is not much of an issue.</p>
    <p>
      @@But replacement of literals is. For one thing, this creates an
      interaction between the syntax of URLs and SGML syntax. We could
      resolve this issue by removing '&amp;' from <a href="/archive/cern/284" original-href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/BNF.html#xalpha" archive-page-id="284">the
        URL syntax</a>
      .</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Headings</h3>
    Six levels of headings are defined: 
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Level four heading</h4>
    <h4>Another level four heading. It's long. It's only conventional and suggested that lines be less than 72 characters long. It's certainly not specified, defined, or required.</h4>
    <h5>Level five heading</h5>
    <h6>Level six heading</h6>
    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
    Normal paragraphs consist of text consisting of words, sentences, and
    other stuff.
    Line breaks are not significant.
    This is still the first
    paragraph of this section.
    <p>
      Here's the second paragraph. It's long. It's only conventional and suggested that lines be less than 72 characters long. It's certainly not specified, defined, or required.</p>
    <p>
      A P tag isn't needed between a paragraph and some other element, like
      a heading.
    </p>
    <h3>Ordered lists</h3>
    These are for things like lists of steps, where the order is
    significant.
    <ol>
      <li>This is the first item of an unordered list. 
      </li>
      <li>This is the second item. It's kinda long, and should wrap around
        on most screens.
      </li>
      <li>This is the third item.
      </li>
      <li>This is the fourth and final item.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Case of names is not significant: different cases</h3>
    <h3>Case of names is not significant: both lower case</h3>
    <h3>TYPEWRITER</h3>
    <typewriter>Anything you could put on a typewriter (or an ASCII display
      device, more precicesly) can be represented in a TYPEWRITER
      element:
      Tags: &lt;start&gt; &lt;/end&gt;
      Entity references: &amp;lt; &amp;amp;
      Tables made from tabs:
      col 1	col 2	col 3	col 4
      1		3	4
      2	3	4
      1	2	3	4
      Plus, you can use <a name="id14" href="/archive/cern/1069" original-href="recommended.html" archive-page-id="1069">hypertext links.</a>
      Linebreaks _are_ significant. There should be three blank lines from here
      to here.</typewriter>
    The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character should be interpreted as the
    smallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number
    of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not
    recommended however.
