  <h1>Document address invalid</h1>
  You have accessed a W3 server and you get back a message "Document
  address invalid or access not authorized". 
  <p>
    The server does not (originally for security reasons) distringuish
    between a document which does not exist, and one to which you are
    not allowed access.  However, most server are public servers which
    allow access to anyone, so if you are following a bona fide link,
    this could mean
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have been passed a bad document address. If you are following
      a link, check with the author of the document which contained the
      link. 
    </li>
    <li>The document has been moved. Check with the server administrator.
      You should be able to find out who runs the server by going to the
      welcome page (g / with the line mdoe browser) and seeing a link to
      information about the maintainers.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If you are the server administrator, and you can't  understand why
  the daemon refuses to deliver the file, 
  <ul>
    <li>Check the <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/738" original-href="RuleFile.html" archive-page-id="738">rule file</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Try <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/3829" original-href="DebugServer.html" archive-page-id="3829">running the daemon with trace from a terminal session</a>
    </li>
