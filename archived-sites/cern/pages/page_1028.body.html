    Ian,</p>
  <p>
    At last I get to send this, some time after our phone call.  Please
    send us, for "Guidance" (assuming this to be a superset of Guide)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Price and ordering information for a single evaluation copy, and any
      indication of larger volume arrangements;
    </li>
    <li>As full documentation as possible; 
    </li>
    <li>Details of your HML format, so that we can consider compatibility
      with our own SGML browsers;
    </li>
    <li>Details of scripts which can be attached to links, so that we can
      investigate the possibility of interfacing to our own information
      access tools.
    </li>
  </ul>
  We have someone who is currently evaluating hypertext products, and
  so we expect to order an evaluation copy immediately.
  <p>
    Thanks in advance</p>
