  <h1>Information stored on the "exp" line.</h1>
  What should we store in the "explanation line" which is generated
  overnight and is turned up by a search?  Don't be confused by the
  term "explanation line - it is historical. In fact it refers to a
  record containing the following information.
  <ul>
    <li>Is there an anchor? Is it already seen? (Should 'seen" information
      be stoerd by the server rather than by the client?)
    </li>
    <li>Name
    </li>
    <li>Explanation - a one-line title
    </li>
    <li>Find group, category and hierarchy level (internal server use only)
    </li>
    <li>Functional flag: Indicates whether a plain text, help, or see prologue
      for more complex things. This is a fudge for the VM FIND application
      only.
    </li>
    <li>Line number of a subset of a master file. Effectively, this is part
      of the filename, when (for ellow pages for example), many small hypertext
      nodes are in fact stored in the same file.
    </li>
    <li>Resposible person's CCID (identifier for WHO).  This information would
      normally be avialable ina hypertext system only when one has jumped
      to the node concerned.
    </li>
  </ul>
