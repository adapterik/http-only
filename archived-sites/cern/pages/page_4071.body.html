  <h1>Record types</h1>
  Each <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/989" original-href="help.html" archive-page-id="989">WHOIS</a> database record has a field saying what type of record
  it is. The main NIC database contains records for individuals, domains,
  groups, hosts, networks, organizations, PSNs (formerly called IMPs),
  TACs, and gateways.  It is advantageous to specify which type of
  record you are looking for since then WHOIS can present fewer, closer
  matches, and can also perform extra searches on fields specific to
  that record type, fields not ordinary searched in a general lookup.
  To search for a specific type of record, put one of the following
  keywords (shown with their minimum abreviation in all CAPS) before
  your target: 
  <dl>
    <dt>Arpanet
    </dt>
    <dd> This finds only "host" records which are on net 10, the ARPANET.
      See below for a description of "hosts". 
    </dd>
    <dt> DOmain
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds a domain record.  Searches the usual places plus the
      domain-name field ("COM", "MIT.EDU", etc). You can match on any pre-dot
      portion of a domain name (that part of the name that precedes the
      dot).  That is, "DOM MIT" would find MIT.EDU. 
    </dd>
    <dt>Gateway
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds gateway records.  Searches the same places as  host,
      below. 
    </dd>
    <dt> HOst
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds records for "hosts", meant more as "machines". Host records
      are found, as well as PSNs, TACs, and gateways.  Looks in the hostname,
      nicknames, net-address, and domain-name fields, with bonus pre-dot
      AND pre-dash matching (i.e. matches text before the '.' or '-' in
      the  name)!  For example, "ho rutgers" finds RUTGERS.EDU,  RUTGERS-GW.RUTGERS.EDU,
      and RED.RUTGERS.EDU, the last one found because RED's name field is
      "Rutgers University. 
    </dd>
    <dt> MIlnet
    </dt>
    <dd> Like Arpanet, this keywords says to find only hosts that 
      are on net 26, the MILNET. 
    </dd>
    <dt> NEtwork
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds network records.  Looks in net-name ("ARPANET",  "S1NET",
      etc) and net-number ("10.0.0.0", "128.15.0.0",  etc), with pre-dot
      matching on net number: "net 10"  and "net 128.15" are eqvivalent
      to the above.  "net 128"  finds all networks with a first octet of
      128. 
    </dd>
    <dt> Organization or Group 
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds org/group records.  Looks in the usual
      places plus nicknames.  Examples: "org rfc", "o net-sponsors". 
    </dd>
    <dt> PSn
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds PSN records.  Checks the usual places plus nicknames, 
      PSN name, and PSN number.  PSN names are like SRI51 and  ROCK-ISLAND;
      "psn 1" will find you OBERURSEL-IMP (MILNET) and UCLA-IMP (ARPANET).
    </dd>
    <dt> Tac
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds TAC records.  Looks in all the host places plus TAC-number,
      which is the BBN-assigned small number identifier for that TAC. 
    </dd>
  </dl>
