  <h1>Compiling httpd</h1>
  The <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/139" original-href="Guide.html" archive-page-id="139">daemon</a> files come in a tar file, which you should uncompress and
  unwrap.   There are also binaries available for some architecures:
  if you have one, already, skip to <a name="6" href="/archive/cern/735" original-href="Installation.html" archive-page-id="735">installation</a>.
  <p>
    In the WWW/Daemon/Implementation directory created are several subdirectories,
    for each machine architecture.  Each has a Makefile. If your machine
    type (eg sun4, NeXT) is not there, copy one that is and its Makefile.</p>
  <p>
    Edit the Makefile to set up particular paths you use on your system.</p>
  <p>
    Type make httpd</p>
  <p>
    Go on to <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/735" original-href="Installation.html" archive-page-id="735">install the deamon</a> under the inetd or in /etc/rc to run continuously.</p>
