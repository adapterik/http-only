  <h1>Web of Indexes</h1>
  In <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/2" original-href="../TheProject.html" archive-page-id="2">WWW</a> , an <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/230" original-href="Navigation.html#8" archive-page-id="230">index</a> is a document like any other. An index may be built
  to cover a certain domain of information. For example, at CERN there
  is a <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/1948">CERN computer center document index</a> . There is a separate <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/1949">functional
    telephone book index</a> . Indexes may be built by the original information
  provider, or by a third party as a value-added service.
  <p>
    Indexes  may point to other indexes.  An index search on one index
    may turn up another index in the result hit list.  In this case, the
    following algorithm seems appropriate.
  </p>
  <h2>Index context</h2>
  Most index searches nowadays, though some look like intelligent semantically
  aware searches, are basically associative keyword searches.  That
  is, a document matches a search if there is a large correlation (with
  or without boolean operations) between the set of words it or its
  abstract contains and the set of words specified in the search. Let
  us consider extending these searches to linked indexes.
  <p>
    Each index has a certain context. This may be represented by a set
    of keywords which may be considered to apply implicitly to everything
    indexed. For example,  in the CERN computer center documentation index,
    one may imagine that everything in it will be considered as pertaining
    to the CERN computer center. We might represent the context by the
    keyword list "CERN computer center documentation physics support".
  </p>
  <h2>Context narrowing</h2>
  Suppose we search a general physics index with the keywords "CERN
  NEWSLETTER".  That index may contain an entry with keyword "CERN"
  pointing to the CERN index.  Therefore, a search on the first index
  will turn up the CERN index. We should then search the CERN index,
  but looking only for the keyword "NEWSLETTER". The keyword "CERN"
  is discarded, as it is assumed by the new context.  In this simple
  model, we can assume that the contextwords could be used directly
  as the keywords for the index itself.
  <p>
    A simple algorithm, then, would be for the server to discard from
    a search list any keywords matching the index's context -- but is
    this really what we want to do?  Perhaps those keywords have a more
    refined meaning within the context. For example, if I am looking for
    documents about document storage schemes at CERN, I might search the
    index with the keyword "documents".  I don't want this to be discarded
    because it is in the context: I am looking for documents about documents.
    It is understood that we are already within the context of computer
    center documentation, so to ask about documentation in this context
    implies more than that I am looking for a document.</p>
  <p>
    A more refined approach would therefore be to strip from the search
    those keywords which were used in order to find the index. The keyword
    list for the entry of one index within anotherthen reflects the change
    in context. 
  </p>
  <h2>Context Broadening</h2>
  We have discussed here only a narrowing of context, not a broadening.
  One can imagine also a reference to a broader context index. In this
  case, perhaps one should add to the search some keywords which come
  from the original context but were not expressed.  This would be dangerous,
  and people would not like it as they often feel that they are expressing
  their request in absolute terms even when they are not. Also, they
  may have been trying to escape from too restricing a context.
  <p>
    One should also consider a search which <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/942" original-href="TracingLinks.html" archive-page-id="942">traces hypertext links</a> as
    well as using indexes.</p>
