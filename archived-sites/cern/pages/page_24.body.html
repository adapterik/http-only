  <h1>WWW people</h1>
  This is a list of some of those who have contributed to the <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/2" original-href="TheProject.html" archive-page-id="2">WWW project</a>
  , and whose work is linked into this web. Unless otherwise stated
  they are at CERN, Phone +41(22)767 plus the extension given below
  or look them up in the <a name="14" href="/archive/cern/200">phone book</a> . Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland.

  <h2>Eelco van Asperen</h2>
  Ported the line-mode browser the PC under PC-NFS; developed a curses
  version. Email: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.
  <h2><a name="11">Carl Barker</a></h2>
  Carl is at CERN for a six month period during his degree course at
  Brunel University, UK.  Carl will be working on the server side, possibly
  on client authentication. Tel: 8265.  Email: barker@cernnext.cern.ch
  <h2><a name="BernersLee">Tim Berners-Lee</a></h2>
  Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among
  other things, document production and text processing. He developped
  his first hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although
  unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background
  in text processing, real-time software and communications, Tim decided
  that high energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN
  was an ideal site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas.
  Tim started the <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/2" original-href="TheProject.html" archive-page-id="2">WorldWideWeb</a> project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the<a name="2" href="/archive/cern/18" original-href="NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html" archive-page-id="18">
    application on the NeXT</a> along with most of the communications software.
  Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch
  <h2><a name="Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a></h2>
  Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction,
  Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when
  he designed and implemented a widely used document markup and formatting
  system. He ran CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89.
  He is a long-time user of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse
  ends as writing trip reports, games, bookkeeping software, and budget
  preparation forms. When he is not doing WWW's public relations, Robert
  is contributing browser software for the Macintosh platform, and analysing
  the needs of physics experiments for online data access. Phone: +41
  (22) 767 50 05, Email: cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch
  <h2>Dan Connolly</h2>
  An early follower of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor
  for his company, and encouraged the use of proper SGML and MIME in
  the future. He wrote a <a name="15" href="/archive/cern/202" original-href="MarkUp/HTML.dtd" archive-page-id="202">DTD for HTML</a> and an <a name="16" href="/archive/cern/203" original-href="Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl" archive-page-id="203">HTML legalizer</a> for old
  files. Email: connolly@pixel.convex.com.
  <h2>Peter Dobberstein</h2>
  While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE),  Peter did the port of the
  line-mode browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the
  most difficult of the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental
  problems in making a large amount of information in the <a name="6" href="/archive/cern/204">DESY database</a>
  available. 
  <h2><a name="9">"Erwise" team</a></h2>
  Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd{nmaanlakka
  ('{' is 'a' with two dots above it.. we must get some character set
  description into HTML!)   (under the supervision of Ari Lemmke)  are
  "Erwise".  At Helsinki Technical University, they  are writing a Motif-based
  WWW browser (editor? we can hope...) for their undergraduate final
  year project. The team can be reached as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari
  as arl@cs.hut.fi.
  <h2>Alain Favre</h2>
  Alain is an undergraduate  working with ECP/PT on a browser for Windows
  on PCs. Phone: 8265, no email yet.  In CERN mostly in the afternoons.
  <h2>David Foster</h2>
  With wide experience in networking, and a current conviction information
  systems and PC/Windows being the way of the future, Dave is having
  a go at a MS-Windows browser/editor. Dave also has a strong interest
  in server technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.
  <h2><a name="Groff">Jean-Francois Groff</a></h2>
  Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay
  at CERN as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991.
  He wrote the<a name="5" href="/archive/cern/167" original-href="VMSHelp/Overview.html" archive-page-id="167"> gateway to the VMS Help system</a> , worked on the new modular
  browser architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels.
  He is now porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set
  up servers for physics experiments.  JF now works for NeXT Europe
  but continues his interest in the web...(<a name="23" href="/archive/cern/205" original-href="People/Groff.html" archive-page-id="205"> Contact</a> )
