  <h2><a name="1">Overview</a></h2>
  Hyperbole is a flexible, extensible personal information manager (PIM).
  Although it is only a two-month-old prototype, it has already proven
  to be quite powerful, with a number of important features absent from
  many research and commercial systems aimed at similar problems.
  <p>
    It represents a synthesis and entension of ideas in user-centered
    information access that we have developed over the last two years.
    It is only the first step towards a distributed multi-media architecture
    that we refer to as a Personalized Information Environment (PIE).
    This report discusses Hyperbole; our ideas on PIEs are discussed separately
    and are the subject of current research work.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole brings the techniques of associative information management
    offered by hypertext systems to the domain of PIMs.  Hypertext is
    a concern that seeks to establish meaningful, easy to follow associations
    among independent and related pieces of text, supporting non-linear
    flow and browsing of information.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole allows one to use any comfortable tools to generate information.
    At any point the information can be easily integrated and further
    adapted for use within Hyperbole, which runs on top of the popular
    GNU Emacs text editor, available on any UNIX system.</p>
  <p>
    Rather than the structured approach taken by most PIMs, Hyperbole
    offers an open framework under which many styles of information and
    task management can be performed.  A mode for entering form-based
    information will be integrated in the near future.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole adds an associative linking facility on top of the standard
    UNIX file system, allowing people to quickly obtain information without
    regard to its storage location.  This facility is quite powerful when
    coupled with a wide-area network, such as the Internet.  Then information
    on a computer in Sweden can be made as easily accessible as that on
    the user's local computer.  As the Internet moves to a fully transparent
    file management model, remote file access will become even easier.</p>
  <p>
    A Hyperbole user need learn only three new concepts, all of which
    are quite simple and familiar to a user of any hypertext system. The
    first concept is buttons.  Buttons provide the user's gateway to information.
    Therefore, they can be embedded within whatever textual information
    the user uses.</p>
  <p>
    The second concept is referents.  Referents are informational destinations.
    They come in a number of different types as explained later.  Most
    referents are information nodes, chunks of information to which a
    user wants access.</p>
  <p>
    The final concept is links.  Links provide an information transport
    mechanism by connecting buttons to referents.  (We have a basic design
    for an interface which allows linkage to and from graphic objects
    but have not yet started implementing it.)</p>
  <p>
    With these concepts, information access is greatly simplified.  A
    user simply selects a pre-designed button which causes a traversal
    of a link to the associated referent.</p>
  <p>
    To manage information, one need only select a label for a button,
    select a referent and ask the system to create a link.  A user can
    create a number of explicit links per minute.  But Hyperbole also
    supports implicit links, links that are implicit in a particular document
    structure, e.g. a hypertext  imported from another system or references
    in an annotated bibliography.  Once Hyperbole is set up to recognize
    a format, a user can traverse implicit links without any prior effort.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole is highly interactive.  Once a link is created, it may be
    immediately tested by selecting the associated button.  There is never
    a need to get into or out of a special mode, though a read-only browser
    mode will be provided for those who want it.  All of Hyperbole's features
    are always available within the editor without interfering with any
    editor functionality.  Link modification and deletion are quick and
    easy.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole provides flexible information access.  It supports the features
    available on a user's display.  From a terminal, all operations are
    available from the keyboard.  On a workstation, a two key mouse interface
    is used, complete with multi-windowed menu operation and button highlighting.
    Hyperbole leaves all information in its original place and format,
    so one need not use a special program just to take quick peeks at
    information.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="16">Research Issues Hyperbole Can Address</a></h2>
  <h3>How can computers improve personal management of information, especially
    in a distributed environment?</h3>
  Hyperbole provides an experimental platform for managing information
  and for building targeted information manager front ends.  Since many
  people will likely want to use it, it will help answer questions that
  we may pose and test in this area.
  <h3>How effective a technique is personally tailored associative data
    management?</h3>
  Does little structure lead to disorganization or does it encourage
  use, thereby encouraging people to put information on line and organize
  it at their own pace, according to their own needs?
  <h3>What tools and techniques are needed to manage personal hyper-information
    spaces (hyperbases)?</h3>
  Hypertext systems have only recently begun to emerge from the research
  environs into limited commercial usage.  Many unanswered questions
  remain including:
  <ul>
    <li>What kinds of navigational tools and techniques are needed?
    </li>
    <li>What kinds of display and compositional abstractions can help people
      perform useful semantic analyses of their information?
    </li>
    <li>What kinds of linkages should be automated and which should be left
      to the user?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How can collaborative, interactive information access aid workgroups?</h3>
  The shift from easily shareable resources on timeshared computers
  to the independently managed resources in PC and workstation networks
  has stimulated a large amount of research into computer-supported,
  cooperative work (CSCW) and groupware applications.  Typically such
  work is tested on the very groups that perform the development.  People
  so conscious of issues in group interaction are likely not to work
  in manners similar to the larger populace; they may, for example,
  be much more adept at sharing information.  They are also overly knowledgable
  in the workings of their system and may unconsciously modify their
  behavior to conform to its requirements.
  <p>
    The textual interface to Hyperbole is quite small and portable.  It
    has a core of only three files.  Thus, it can be delivered quite easily
    to a set of diverse groups for testing in unbiased locales.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="13">Key Features of Hyperbole</a></h2>
  <h3>No Fixed Structure Model</h3>
  A number of hypertext systems impose a fixed structure on the nodes
  in their hypertexts.  A common limitation is to apportion information
  in screen-sized portions known as frames.  Apple's Hypercard, MaxThink's
  PC hypertext products, and Knowledge Management System's KMS all have
  this limitation.
  <p>
    In contrast, Hyperbole imposes no common structure on all hypertexts
    built with it.  Since it is intended as both a delivery tool and a
    research vehicle, it is meant to serve as a framework under which
    researchers or developers may try out and deliver hypertexts of varying
    formats and levels of structure.  Thus, Hyperbole hypertexts can be
    fashioned in the image of any of the above mentioned systems if so
    desired.  However, one can also include extremely lengthy</p>
  <p>
    files as nodes, allowing the user to freely move through such files
    as he sees fit.  In hypertext terminology, Hyperbole supports both
    fine-grained and course-grained links.</p>
  <p>
    Some systems also define intra-node structure, a carry-over from paper
    forms and the record-field structure of databases.  Hypercard uses
    fields nested within cards to support form completion applications.</p>
  <p>
    Clearly there is a need for a mix of structure and non-structure.
    Hypercard descended from an initial rolodex-type system prototype,
    so let us look at this application.  We have seen over ten rolodex
    systems across a range of platforms and all of have used the card-field
    metaphor.  There are a number of problems that this kind of setup
    cannot handle.  Consider an entry for a dialup computer with twelve
    different phone numbers.  Most rolodexes would only permit two numbers
    per entry. And what about the person with two home phones, a work
    phone, a cellular phone, a pager and a fax number?  We are forced
    to place much of this information in an unstructured information field,
    if available.  And then we lose the advantage of structured fields,
    such as autodial support invoked by selecting a telephone field.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole puts the work burden on the machine rather than the user
    for such a task.  The user can enter any information he wants in any
    order as a rolodex record.  Pattern matching is then used to extract
    phone numbers, electronic-mail addresses, etc. from the entries. A
    primitive form interface exists to demonstrate that Hyperbole can
    be used to imitate the more structured interfaces when needed.  We
    conclude that people should be able to get structure when they want
    it and totally avoid it when it is of little or no use to them.</p>
  <p>
    Our design philosophy is heavily user-centered for two reasons.  We
    seek to demonstrate the important productivity impact that easily
    learned interfaces can have in information intensive tasks.  We further
    want to make the system appealing enough to encourage widespread adoption
    as both an end-user tool and a framework for targeting specific information
    delivery applications.
  </p>
  <h3>Collaboration</h3>
  A special facility allows two users to collaborate by following Hyperbole
  links in lock step, as long as they both have access to any files
  referenced by the links.  Where one goes, so does the other.  The
  facility generalizes to support broadcast to any number of users.
  Speed over a LAN is quite good.  Here is an actual sample from a Hyperbole
  demonstration:
  <xmp>	One can collaborate  with  another  person  across  the
    network by traversing nodes  together.   Simply  select
    &lt;</xmp>
  <pre><collaborate>&gt;.  Later  one  can  &lt;</collaborate><disconnect>&gt;  from
	collaboration.   This  can  be  either  a  master-slave
	relationship   when   only   the   master   issues  the
	collaboration command and the slave follows along or it
	can  be  a  peer-to-peer  relation  when   both   issue
	collaboration commands to each other.  Then either host
	can  traverse  nodes  and  update  the other's display.
	Many  other  systems  permit  only   the   master-slave
	relation  or  require  that  both  users  have   bitmap
	displays.  With this interface, one person can be on  a
	bitmap display and the other on a character terminal or
	any other combination of the two.

</disconnect></pre>
  Consider how voice broadcast facilities are used by police and firemen
  working on common problems.  When one person obtains new information
  or happens upon a critical situation, he can quickly broadcast this
  to his fellow workers.  A similar need arises when a group of distributed
  people are working on a common information intensive task, e.g. performing
  background research for an upcoming trial, analyzing news reports
  for emerging trends, or performing a walkthrough of a software design.
  <p>
    Hyperbole's collaboration facility can be used as a rapid broadcast
    mechanism in such instances.  Unlike other computer-based broadcast
    facilities, it does not present a short, out of context message. Instead
    it can show critical information with surrounding context and embedded
    hyper-buttons to further guide the readers to either more expansive
    or deeper material.
  </p>
  <h3>Mailable Links</h3>
  Links may be created when one is composing mail within Emacs.  Anyone
  to whom the mail is sent may then follow such links, assuming he has
  Hyperbole installed and has access to the associated material.
  <p>
    Mail links remain invisible so neither the creator nor the receiver
    ever sees them.  Each only sees the buttons embedded within messages.
    From a user perspective, mail links look exactly like any other Hyperbole
    links.</p>
  <p>
    Buttons embedded within Subject lines may be selected from both the
    messages themselves and any Subject summary listings in which they
    appear.
  </p>
  <h3>Mode-Specific Button Handling</h3>
  Hyperbole supports multiple button representations in files.  Thus,
  an electronic mail message file could contain standard Hyperbole buttons
  but could also have its "From: " address treated as an implicit button
  which displays any rolodex entry corresponding to the address. Similarly,
  selection of a reference such as "see page 26" within a document could
  display that page.
  <p>
    Implicit buttons are useful in files in which a number of buttons
    perform the same action.  In such cases, it would be wasteful to record
    individual links; instead one procedure serves all similar buttons
    in the file.  This technique is useful when large button menus are
    built, e.g. to give access to the UNIX manual pages via a set of summary
    description lines, one per manual topic.</p>
  <p>
    The implication is that instead of developing completely independent
    development and browsing environments for application specific tasks,
    one could much more quickly add a special mode or two that interfaces
    to Hyperbole.  This kind of strategy, besides saving time, leaves
    the rest</p>
  <p>
    of a user's custom environment available to him, while interacting
    with the special modes.  This helps minimize learning time.  It represents
    a tool-based strategy familiar to UNIX shell users.
  </p>
  <h3>Complete, Mature Programming Language</h3>
  Hyperbole is written in Lisp, which means that the entirety of the
  Lisp language is available for extending its functionality.  Since
  Lisp is interpreted, extensions may be immediately tested in a bottom-up
  fashion.  Even with interpretation, link traversal and creation are
  both
  <p>
    quite fast.</p>
  <p>
    Hyperbole supports procedural links which evaluate arbitrary Lisp
    expressions whenever their corresponding buttons are selected.  Since
    many users will not know Lisp, an alternative, the keyboard macro
    link, is provided.  The user simply tells the system to watch and
    to save the</p>
  <p>
    keystrokes to whatever he does until he issues a stop command.  The
    resulting macro may then be used as the target of a link.
  </p>
  <h3>Arbitrary External Calls</h3>
  External call interfaces are available to allow a Hyperbole link to
  execute any sequence of shell commands or to redirect input and output
  to a batch or even window-based program.
  <h3>Terminal/Workstation/Mainframe Portability and Access</h3>
  Since Hyperbole is layered on top of GNU Emacs, it is portable across
  over 30 different brands of computers, from low-end to high-end machines.
  <h3>No Data Format Conversions Necessary</h3>
  All Hyperbole link data is stored in an ASCII format, as are Hyperbole
  buttons.  Links are stored outside of the files with which they are
  associated.  Button labels are simply arbitrary strings in a file
  <p>
    surrounded by special delimiters, e.g. &gt;. The user need not worry
    about spacing or line breaks between words in a button label; the
    system normalizes the label text before it looks for the corresponding
    link.  So the effort to create and manage buttons</p>
  <p>
    within bodies of text is minimal.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="12">Secondary Features</a></h2>
  Integration of remote information access protocols is fairly straightforward.
  Hyperbole currently supports transparent Internet ftp services and
  we are examining other protocols that will enrich its
  <p>
    ability to deal with heterogenous machines and networks.</p>
  <p>
    Button creation and deletion is provided.  Modification is not yet
    available.  It represents a rather simple addition.</p>
  <p>
    A history mechanism is included.  It simply returns the user to his
    site prior to following the last link.  It can also jump back any
    number of links with one command.</p>
  <p>
    Under the X window version of Emacs known as Epoch, hyper-buttons
    can be highlighted in any desired color so that they are easy to see.
    When a button is selected, it flashes to give the user feedback on
    his selection.</p>
  <p>
    Both a mouse-based and key-based interfaces are provided.  Commands
    may be selected from a  menu.</p>
  <p>
    The following link types are currently provided with more being developed:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>DirLink 
    </dt>
    <dd>references a UNIX directory
    </dd>
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>ExecLink
    </dt>
    <dd> executes an arbirary Lisp form, e.g. a shell command
    </dd>

    </dd>
    <dt>MenuLink
    </dt>
    <dd> references a menu of buttons
    </dd>
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>RegionLink
    </dt>
    <dd> references a non-delimited segment of text within a larger
      unit of text, such as a file
    </dd>
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>SectionLink
    </dt>
    <dd> references a delimited segment of text within a larger
      unit of text, such as a file
    </dd>
  </dl>
  Implicit links are presently handled in a special manner.  They can
  be of any of the above types.  Global buttons, which may be selected
  within any working context will be added in the near future.
  <h2><a name="9">Prototype Utilities</a></h2>
  <h3>Auto and Manual Dialer</h3>
  We have put together a popup telephone keypad of buttons that can
  emit actual touchtones from a workstation.  This is coupled with an
  auto-dialer facility that will extract an appropriate telephone number
  from a rolodex when given a person's name.  With a little more work,
  it will store prefix codes for calling cards, etc., so that one could
  simply select a name, hold the phone near the computer speaker and
  have it autodial for you.  Adaptation for use with other dialing devices
  <p>
    would not be difficult.
  </p>
  <h3>Annotated Bibliography Browser</h3>
  References to sources within a bibliography, e.g. [Diamond90] may
  be selected and the corresponding reference displayed in another window.

  Of the four no answers in the Hyperbole column, we plan to remove
  all of them aside from the data versioning one.  Interestingly, the
  two systems with scores higher than Hyperbole have been developed
  over lengthy periods.  NLS/Augment is a timeshared system developed
  over a more than
  <p>
    twenty year period.  It is no longer in general use but represents
    the most sophisticated hypermedia working environment to date.  The
    Guide system has been developed for the last nine years at the University
    of Kent at Canterbury in England.  A Scottish company, Office Workstations
    Ltd. has marketed their own derivative versions for Macs and PCs since
    1986.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="5">Availability</a></h2>
  A first release of Hyperbole should be available by September 1991.
  We would hope by then to also be able to include a useful set of personal
  productivity templates with which people can start.
  <h2><a name="3">Conclusion</a></h2>
  Hyperbole presents a working prototype of a powerful personal information
  manager.  It offers extremely intuitive browsing capabilities and
  excellent extensibility to meet specific application demands.  It
  will server as a basis for further research on large-scale free text
  and graphics management and delivery.</div>
