  <h1>Installing a daemon under inetd</h1>
  The usual way to install a daemon is to either run it from the bootstrap
  command file (for example /etc/rc) so that it runs continuously, or
  to set up the internet daemon (inetd) to run it when a call comes
  in. 
  <p>
    There is a csh script to do all this for BSD systems, which should
    be run from the directory in which you have compiled the daemon.
  </p>
  <h2></h2>
  Copy the daemon program or shell script (<a name="6" href="/archive/cern/139" original-href="Guide.html" archive-page-id="139"> httpd</a> in this example) into
  a suitable directory such as /usr/etc/httpd.  Protect it from anyone
  writing to it except root.
  <p>
    Put "http" in the /etc/services file, or use the name of a specific
    service of your own if you want to use have a special port number.</p>
  <p>
    (Exceptions: on a NeXT, see  using the <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/3825" original-href="NetInfo.html" archive-page-id="3825">NetInfomanager</a> . On any machine
    running NIS (yellow pages), see  specicial instructions ). </p>
  <p>
    For example,
  </p>
  <xmp>www		80/tcp			# WorldWideWeb server
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Put a line in the internet daemon configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf.
  For example,
  <listing>www	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/etc/httpd		httpd -l /private/adm/httpd-log.txt
  </listing>(That was all one line.) Here "www" is used as a link between the
  services file and inetd.conf: it could have been any identifier. "nobody"
  is the user name under which you want the daemon to run, which determines
  what privileges it has for example to read data. The inted.conf format
  varies from system to system so copy the format of other lines in
  your version.
  <p>
    Note: there seem to be, on the NeXT at least, a limit of 4 arguments
    passed across by inetd!When you have updated inted.conf, find out
    which process is running inetd, and send it a "HUP" signal.  On BSD
    unix (For system V, use ps-el for ps aux) this looks like:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    &gt; ps aux | grep inetd | grep -v grep
    root        85   0.0  0.9 1.24M  304K ?  S     0:01 /usr/etc/inetd
    &gt; kill -HUP 85
    &gt;
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>Also remember for httpd:</h2>
  You must make or copy a rule file /etc/httpd.conf, unless you have
  used the -r option to change its location, or -R to disable it.
  <p>
    The -r option tells the daemon which rule file to use.  See <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/738" original-href="RuleFile.html" archive-page-id="738">rule files</a>
    .</p>
  <p>
    If  a log file is required,  make sure that the user name under which
    the daemon is run (the 5th field in the line above) has the right
    to write the file.</p>
  <p>
    Test the server with the line mode browser by giving its address explicitly:
  </p>
  <xmp>			www http://myhost.dom.ain:80/junkdocumentname
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  If it doesn't work, you have probably missed something. See notes
