  <h1>Link Types</h1>
  See <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/233" original-href="Topology.html#4" archive-page-id="233">discussion of whether links should
    be typed</a> .
  <p>
    Descriptive (normal) link types are
    mainly for the benefit of users and
    tracing, and graphics representation
    algorithms. Some link types for example
    express relationships between the
    things described by two nodes.</p>
  <p>
    A Is part of B  / B includes A</p>
  <p>
    A Made B / B is made by A</p>
  <p>
    A Uses B  / B is used by A</p>
  <p>
    A refers to B / B is referred to
    by A
  </p>
  <h2>Magic link types</h2>
  These have a significance known to
  the system, and may be treated in
  special ways.  Many of these relate
  whole nodes, rather than particular
  anchors within them.  (See also <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/233" original-href="Topology.html#12" archive-page-id="233">multiended
    links</a> and predicate logic) Suggestions:
  <h2>UseIndex</h2>
  The destination is the related index
  for a search by a user reading this
  document who asks for an index search
  function.
  <p>
    A document may have any number of
    index links, causing several indexes
    top be searched in a client-defined
    manner.
  </p>
  <h2>UseGlossary</h2>
  The destination of the link is an
  index which should be used to resiolve
  glossary queries in the document.
  (Typically, a double-clik on a word
  which is not within an anchor).
  <p>
    A document may have any number of
    glossary links.
  </p>
  <h2>Annotation</h2>
  The information in the destination
  node is additional to that in the
  source node, and may be viewed at
  the same time. It may be filtered
  out (as a function of author?).
  <p>
    Annotation is used by one person
    to write the equivalent of "margin
    notes" or other criticism on another's
    document, for example.</p>
  <p>
    <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/942" original-href="TracingLinks.html" archive-page-id="942">Tracing</a> may ignore annotations when
    generating trees or sequences.
  </p>
  <h2>Embedded information</h2>
  If this link is followed, the node
  at the end of it is embedded into
  the display of the source node. This
  is supported by Guide, but not many
  other systems.  It is used, in effect,
  by those systems (VAX/notes under
  Decwindows, Microsoft Word) which
  allow "Outlining" -- expanding a
  tree bit by bit.
  <p>
    The browser has a more difficult
    job to do if this is supported.
  </p>
  <h2>person described by node A is author
    of node B</h2>
  This information can be used for
  protection, and informing authors
  of interest, for sending mail to
  authors, etc.
  <h2>person described by node A is interested
    in node B</h2>
  This information can be used for
  informing readers of changes.
  <h2><a name="1">Node A is in fact a previous version
      of node B</a></h2>
  <h2>Node A is in fact a set of differences
    between B and its previousversion. This information will probably
    not be stored as nodes, but be generated
    from regular diff files. or some
    other delta method.
