  <h1>Updates To HTTP</h1>
  The HTTP protocol implements the WWW <a name="13" href="/archive/cern/858" original-href="../../Administration/DataModel.html" archive-page-id="858">data model</a> .
  <p>
    In order to improve the functionality of WWW, the HyperText Transfer
    Protocol needs to be altered (see also: <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/37" original-href="AsImplemented.html" archive-page-id="37">current HTTP implementation,</a><a name="9" href="/archive/cern/860" original-href="../../DesignIssues/ProtocolVersions.html#12" archive-page-id="860">
      from version to version,</a> our <a name="11" href="/archive/cern/190" original-href="../../Notation.html#1" archive-page-id="190">BNF</a> notation and the <a name="8" href="/archive/cern/282" original-href="../HTTP.html" archive-page-id="282">original HTTP design</a>
    ).</p>
  <p>
    A prime concern is that servers must be able to skip data they don't
    understand. This will guarantee forward compatibility.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="5">Request</a></h2>
  As before, the client sends a request, but may specify additional
  information.  The format of the new request is:
  <xmp>
    Request ::= Get | Put
    Get ::=   GET Udi [CiLang]/VersionNumber CrLf
    ClientInfo
    Put ::=   PUT Udi [Cilang]/VersionNumber CrLf
    ClientInfo CrLf
    DataInfo CrLf
    [body section]
    CiLang ::=  HTRQ
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Udi is the Universal Document Identifier.
  <p>
    CiLang specifies the language used to write the ClientInfo and the
    DataInfo after the GET line. At the moment only <a name="12" href="/archive/cern/861" original-href="../../MarkUp/HTRQ.html" archive-page-id="861">HTRQ</a> is defined .</p>
  <p>
    VersionNumber gives the HTTP version being used by the client.</p>
  <p>
    If the protocol version is not specified, the server assumes that
    the browser uses HTTP version 0.9 (before this update was carried
    out) (See "<a name="14" href="/archive/cern/860" original-href="../../DesignIssues/ProtocolVersions.html" archive-page-id="860"> From Version to Version</a> ").</p>
  <p>
    GET means retrieve whatever data is identified by the Udi, so where
    the Udi refers to a data-producing process, or a script which can
    be run by such a process, it is this data which will be returned,
    and not the source text of the script or process.</p>
  <p>
    PUT specifies that the data in the body section is to be stored under
    the supplied Udi, (but see constraint on <a name="16" href="/archive/cern/861" original-href="../../MarkUp/HTRQ.html#13" archive-page-id="861">modification times</a> ).</p>
  <p>
    Where the Udi refers to a data-producing process, PUT is not applicable,
    and will fail. The process should label its response as non-editable.</p>
  <p>
    [JFG] Beware here of lexical problems like different character sets
    on client and server, CR/LF conventions, etc. Also, elementary file
    locking should be provided.
  </p>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <h2>Response</h2>
  The response from the server may be straight HTML (in the case of
  older servers), or may start with the following syntax:
  <xmp>                  RESPONSE=String HTTPV=VersionNumber CrLf
    ...
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  String identifies the type of the response, VersionNumber identifies
  the HyperText Transfer Protocol version being used by the server.
  Then follows additional information depending on the response type.
  <p>
    The keywords, here in upper case, are case insensitive. Quotes may
    be ommited where String does not contain special characters (such
    as spaces).</p>
  <p>
    The response String may have the following values (see <a name="15" href="/archive/cern/858" original-href="../../Administration/DataModel.html" archive-page-id="858">data model</a>
    ):
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>ERROR
    </dt>
    <dd> the server encountered an abnormal condition,
    </dd>
    <dt>FORWARD
    </dt>
    <dd> the data requested has been assigned a new Udi, the change
      is permanent.  (N.B. this is an optimisation, which must, pragmatically,
      be included in this definition.  Browsers should automatically relink
      to the new reference, where possible),
    </dd>
    <dt>REDIRECTION
    </dt>
    <dd> the data requested actually resides under a different
      Udi, however, the redirection may be altered on occasion (when making
      links to these kinds of document, the browser should default to using
      the Udi of the redirection document, but have the option of linking
      to the final document),
    </dd>
    <dt>QUERY
    </dt>
    <dd> the data is composed of (1) the identification of a server and
      (2) the algorithm in some arbitrary language, to be passed to the
      server which will use it to extract the data.
    </dd>
    <dt>INDEX
    </dt>
    <dd> the data is the "front page" of a data base, to which further
      search keys have to be supplied before desired data can be extracted.
      A search panel has to be put up by the browser. The front page is
      otherwise a normal HTML document, including the possibilities of containing
      anchors.
    </dd>
    <dt>DATA
    </dt>
    <dd> this is the data requested,
    </dd>
    <dt>CONFIRMATION
    </dt>
    <dd> the command transmitted has been successfully completed
      (PUT command).
    </dd>
  </dl>
  Detailed syntax of  the response is given in <a name="17" href="/archive/cern/1867" original-href="HTRESP.html" archive-page-id="1867">HTRESP</a> .</div>
