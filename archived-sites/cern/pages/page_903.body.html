  <h1>Programme</h1>
  This is a summary of the <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/244" original-href="Introduction.html" archive-page-id="244">ECHT90</a> conference program. The conference consisted of a day of<a name="1" href="#tut"> tutorial</a> sessions, then two days of <a name="2" href="#pap">paper</a> presentations with parallel track of <a name="3" href="#pan">panel</a> sessions and an<a name="4" href="/archive/cern/1027" original-href="Exhibition.html" archive-page-id="1027"> exhibition</a> of products and posters. The content of most of these are are available in the proceedings, which were distributed in paper book form at registration time (the proceedings include the question/answers of the panel sessions, surely a world first!). The working language was English. The term Hypertext should now certainly be replaced by hypermedia: all products I  <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/1924" original-href="Authors.html#Cailliau" archive-page-id="1924">(RC)</a> saw that were remotely interesting included not only text and graphics, but also the possibility of animation (eg. video) and sound (eg. voice). The overall attendence was around 450.

  <h2><a name="pan">Panel Sessions</a></h2>
  The panel sessions were held in a smaller room than the papers, with a panel of 3 to 5 people entertaining an audience which varied between 50 and 300. The sessions each started with a (short) presentation by each of the panellists, after which the floor was opened for discussion. The panels were nominally on the following subjects:-
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="pan3">What should hypermedia authoring systems for computer aided instruction look like?</a>
    </li>
    <li>
