  <p>
    WHOIS is used to look up records in the main NIC database.  Each 
    record has a "handle" (a unique identifier assigned to it by the NIC),
    a name, a record type, and various other fields depending on the
    type of record.</p>
  <p>
    To use WHOIS, simply type in your target string.  The default action,
    unless directed otherwise with a keyword (e.g. "domain root"), is
    to do a very broad search, looking for matches to your target in
    many fields: handle, name, nicknames, hostname, net address, imp
    name, etc,and finding all record types.</p>
  <p>
    WHOIS then shows the results in one of two ways: as a full, detailed
    display for a single match (with possible subdisplay), or as one-
    or two-line summaries for multiple matches. Often the search finds
    more records than just the one wanted.  To look up a single, specific
    record, put a '!' before your target, which should be the handle
    of that record.  In summary lines, the handle is shown in parenthesis
    following the name, which is first on the line. So, typing "!ABC"
    will look up the record whose handle is "ABC".</p>
  <p>
    If you don't know what it is exactly you're looking for, you can do
    a "partial" search, meaning you will specify the partial target
    string, and everything STARTING with that target will be found.
    Put a trailing dot (or dots) after your text to indicate this. For
    example, typing "mack." will find "Mack", "Mackall", "Mackay", etc.
