  <h1>Mailboxes</h1>
  Mailbox is one of the fields routined checked in a general search,
  and  if your target contains an '@', it is the ONLY field tried.
  Input of  "joe" would find mailboxes "joe@..." and "joe%...". 
  <p>
    Mailboxes are stored in the database with the host part canonicalized,
    that is, made official.  If you use a non-official hostname or 
    nickname, it is automatically canonicalized for you before the search.
    If the named host is not known, the search is performed anyway on
    the exact target string. </p>
  <p>
    You may search for mailboxes any of three ways: 
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>user@
    </dt>
    <dd> Looks for mailboxes with a username part of 
      <dd> "user" on any
        host. This is a fast search. 
      </dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>@host
    </dt>
    <dd> Finds ALL mailboxes on host "host".  This is  a SLOW search.
    </dd>
    <dt>user@host
    </dt>
    <dd> Looks for an exact mailbox match, user andhost parts both.
      This is fastest. 
    </dd>
  </dl>
