  There was not a lot of discussion of this at <a href="/archive/cern/244" original-href="Introduction.html" archive-page-id="244">ECHT90</a>,
  but there seem to be two leads:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="/archive/cern/266" original-href="People.html#newcombe" archive-page-id="266">Steve newcombe's</a> and Goldfarber's "Hytime" committee
      looking into SGML, and
    </li>
    <li>An ISO working group known as MHEG, "Multimedia/HyperText Expert Group".
      led by one Francis Kretz (Thompsa SA? Rennes?).
    </li>
  </ol>
