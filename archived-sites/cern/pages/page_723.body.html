  <h1>Making a server</h1>
  Here is a run-through of what is needed to make a <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/107" original-href="Overview.html" archive-page-id="107">www server</a> , with
  examples from a suggested server for the HEPDATA base of <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/1781">Mike Whalley</a>
  . See also <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/222" original-href="Etiquette.html" archive-page-id="222">etiquette</a> .
  <p>
    Basically, to make the data available, you make a server which is
    a modified version of your program. When a user follows a link to
    HEPDATA (or runs a command to jump straight there), the client program
    opens a connection to a server program on a VM machine (say, but could
    be VMS or unix). The server in turn runs your program.</p>
  <p>
    Let me just describe the essence of the changes needed so that you
    can get an idea of how much effort would be involved.</p>
  <p>
    The first thing you do is to make up an arbitrary naming method for
    anything which HEPDATA can display.  In this I include the welcome
    page, any menu, any article, any help text.  Typically one invents
    a hierarchical naming scheme, like
  </p>
  <xmp>	/HEPDATA			The first "welcome" menu
    /HEPDATA/HELP			The top-level help
    /HEPDATA/HELP/REAC		The help on the reaction database.
    /HEPDATA/REAC			The reaction database itself
    /HEPDATA/REAC?P+PBAR		list of reactions involving p and pbar (?)
    /HEPDATA/DATA/RD125V687		Some article (say).
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  You do this because, whereas an interactive user follows a path through
  the program, the W3 user calls the program once for each thing. There
  is no "state" information. This allows one to make a hypertext link
  to any part of the scheme and jump back in again later. For example,
  one might want to quote an article, or the reaction database, or a
  particular list of reactions.
  <p>
    Now all you do is modify the program so that, given a name above,
    it will</p>
  <p>
    return the required document.  This means basically turning it from
    a sequence the user goes through into a set of conditionals to isolate
    each of the individual cases above. Apart from that, the data retrieval
    code is unchanged apart from the output formatting.  Many of the options
    in fact mean mapping the name onto a fixed</p>
  <p>
    file's name its the searches which have to activate real code.</p>
  <p>
    The hypertext trick you need to use in the menus. Where an option
    is normally output to the screen, you have to tell the client what
    to ask for is the user selects that option. For example, in the main
    menu /HEPDATA you have an option which gives the help. You would represnt
    this "anchor" as<a name="4" href="/archive/cern/1782" original-href="/HEPDATA/HELP" archive-page-id="1782"> Help </a>"Help" is all that is displayed, with some indication
    that it is an option. If the user choses (clicks a mouse on, choses
    by number depending on which client he has) then the client asks the
    server for /HEPDATA/HELP. ("A" is for "anchor", "HREF" is for "hypertext
    reference")</p>
  <p>
    For the index searches, it's as simple. When the server sends the
    text called /HEPDATA/REAC it also sends a special tag . This tells
    the client to enable a FIND command, or find panel etc (depending
    on the client). You don't have to do any human interface work. The
    client automatically comes back with a search coded up in the form
    /HEPDATA/REAC?P+PBAR etc. Your server in turn returns a menu (say)
    with pointers to the data which has been found.</p>
  <p>
    You can also put some formatting tags (like headings) which will make
    the data look really nice on a window system.</p>
