  WHEN USING MAILBASE ...
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Be sure of the mail address!   In particular, do not send commands
      intended for Mailbase to a  discussion list!  When using the discussion
      lists ...
    </li>
  </ul>
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a descriptive 'Subject:' field in your mail message. This helps
      you and your colleagues sort and file mail messages.
    </li>
    <li>When using abbreviations and acronyms type out the phrase in full
      the first time you use it.  Hence: the Networked Information Services
      Project (NISP).
    </li>
    <li>The lines of your messages should be no longer than about 75  characters
      in length.  This makes for easy on-line reading.
    </li>
  </ul>

  WHEN REPLYING ...
  <xmp>
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider whether your reply should go to the whole list or only to
      the originator of the message.  THIS ALWAYS REQUIRES THOUGHT.
    </li>
    <li>Remember the person you are replying to is human!  So ...
    </li>
    <li>It is unwise to react quickly to a message, especially if it has annoyed
      you.  A good practice is to draft a long (or a hasty) reply and then
      send it later in the day, after reviewing it.
    </li>
    <li>Never send electronic mail when angry or upset.
    </li>
    <li>When a message stings you into drafting an angry retort it is worth
      asking yourself if you need reply at all.  Leave it to your colleagues
      to point out another's shortcomings!
    </li>
    <li>Refer to the message to which you are replying, summarising it if
      appropriate. Some mail programs enable you to include the old message
      in your reply, so that you can reply to it point by point.  If your
      mail  program can do this, delete all parts of the old message which
      are irrelevant.
    </li>
    <li>When asking a question in a discussion list, request that people reply
      direct to you, and then build a summary of the replies for later publication
      in the list.  This saves a lot of what others, not interested in the
      particular point, would call 'junk mail'.
    </li>
    <li>Be careful with humour and sarcasm - it doesn't always read the way
      you intended it.  Some people use a smiley face ':-)' to indicate
      their friendly intention (look at :-) sideways).
    </li>
    <li>Don't overdo signatures.  Some people add their own personalised signature
      to each of their mail messages.  This can soon grate on a mailing
      list reader, particularly if the signature is longer than the contribution.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Some mail programs do not permit a 'signature' as an option: you either
  have it or you don't.  If your signature is not an option, try to
  cut it to two lines.
  <p>
    FINALLY ...  Discussion lists can be fun and useful.  Observing these
    few basic rules of 'e-mail etiquette' will make your discussions with
    colleagues refreshingly informal and productive.  Why not take the
    plunge now?</p>
