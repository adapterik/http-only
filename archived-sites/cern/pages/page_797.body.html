  <h1>Field names</h1>
  When you search for a person in the WHO database, you normally search
  with their name. In fact, words you give will be matched against any
  part of  a person's phone book record, so you can search by phone
  number or division, for example.
  <p>
    You can, however, specify that a value must match a particular field
    by prefixing it with a field name. Field names all start with colons
    (:) to distinguish them from any other data.</p>
  <p>
    You can give many such sets of field name and value(s), which must
    all match (logical AND) for a name to be displayed.  Here are some
    field names -- these can be abreviated to two letters:
  </p>
