  Most records, be they for individuals, machines, or organizations
  will  have a name field; those that do not will display "[No name]"
  in their  record output.  For individuals, the name is in last-first
  order, with  any title coming at the end: 
  <xmp>	Smith, John
    Smith, John Q.
    Smith, John Q., III
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Other records typically have name fields like: 
  <xmp>	Smith College
    Smith &amp; James Co.
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  You may specify any part of a name up to a space or comma, it will
  match everything starting with with that target: "Smith" would match
  all of the above records.  "Smith, John" would find those three
  people  above and plenty more.  Additionally, "Smith, J" can be used
  to find all Smiths with a first initial of 'J'.

    Don't forget about partial searches.  A partial search on the name
    field is often what will find the record you're looking for.  Refer
