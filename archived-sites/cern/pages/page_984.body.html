  <h2>WELCOME TO MAILBASE!</h2>
  Mailbase is the prototype service of the Newcastle-based JNT Networked
  Information Services Project (NISP).  It offers its users two main
  facilities:
  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discussion of topics using electronic mail (e-mail).  Mailbase 'manages'
      electronic circulation lists.  Being a member of a particular list
      is like sitting in a discussion.  You can join in, or merely observe.
    </li>
    <li>Commands for retrieving files associated with a discussion list and
      for obtaining information about other lists or about Mailbase in general.
    </li>
  </ul>
  An interactive interface to allow 'browsing' through some of this
  information is also planned.
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope that Mailbase will prove to be a helpful facility for you:
    please read these notes when you start to use the service.  We recommend
    that you experiment with Mailbase by sending it commands (for example,
    index and send) before you start contributing to a list.  Please contact
    your list owner or us if you have any comments about Mailbase or any
    difficulty in using it: see the e-mail <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/1973" original-href="Addresses.html" archive-page-id="1973">addresses</a> . The sections of
