  <h1>Multiuser considerations</h1>
  Multiuser access is made easier with a client/server model.We obviously
  want this. We also need simultaneous reading and writing of the same
  database.  This is done by locking parts or all of the database while
  they are updated. One has to decide on the unit of data to be locked.
  I (<a name="5" href="/archive/cern/24" original-href="../People.html#BernersLee" archive-page-id="24"> TBL</a> ) imagine that it  would be a node, not a database.
  <p>
    There is a specific problem which all distributed hypertext systems
    have had to tackle, in <a name="6" href="/archive/cern/937" original-href="LinkToLiving.html" archive-page-id="937">linking to living documents</a>.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="2">Annotation</a></h2>
  Annotation is the  linking of a new commentary node to someone else's
  existing node. It is the essence of a collaborative hypertext.  An
  annotation does not modify the text necessarily: one can separate
  protection against writing and annotation.
  <h2><a name="1">Protection</a></h2>
  Protection against unauthorized reading and writing is provided by
  servers. We use the word ªdomainº to describe a set of data which
  has the same protection.  Life is simple if the domain is the database,
  or all the data administered by a given server.  One can also add
  author-based protection to the contents of a node, or links, which
  have author information stored about them.
  <p>
    There is a problem illustrated by the following example. One might
    want to make a private annotation to something which is visible world-wide
    but unwritable. The annotation would be invisible to another reader:
    it would be stored in a private domain.  The  node itself is visible
    everywhere: it is stored in a public domain. This is a general problem
    of links being in a different domain to nodes.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="3">Private overlaid web</a></h2>
  A possible solution to this is to have, in the private domain,  a
  partial copy of the public web, so that link information can be added
  to it.  The copy of the net could also be used to tag on local cached
  copies of the contents of the remote nodes.
  <p>
    The writer would have to be aware of the domain into which he was
    writing.  One could use a server per domain, but could imagine the
    need for more than one server per domain, or more than one domain
    per server.</p>

  <h2>Locking and modifying</h2>
  Modification of text in  a multiuser environment requires in principle
  some sort of atomic locking feature, so that two users do not update
  the same text at the same time. In fact some systems do not have this
  and still survive quite well: it depends a lot on the human environment.
  <p>
    Practically, the HTTP protocol must contain a lock/unlock command,
    and some way of recovering from a lock left on by a vanished user.
    The actual implementation will depend on the server or gateway. In
    the case of files, then a number of possibilitie exist:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>One can write-protect the file temporarily. This unfortunately levaes
      no clue as to who has locked it, when and why. It is also indistinguishable
      from a genuine protection to a document which should not be modified
    </li>
    <li>One can create  a lock file containing information about who/when/why,
      whose name is derived from the name of the file in question. </li>
  </ul>
