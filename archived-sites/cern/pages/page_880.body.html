  <h1>Use of CVS</h1>
  <h2>History</h2>
  of <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/221" original-href="../IntroCVS.html" archive-page-id="221">introducing CVS</a> in WWW code management
  <h2>Short Description</h2>
  Code management in WWW is done with tools to be found in the directory
  hypertext/WWW/CodeManagexec.
  <p>
    CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is installed there, with all its
    sources. </p>
  <p>
    CVS keeps all versions and all branches of a particular source file
    "f.c" in a single file "f.c,v". This file has a structure which uses
    the differences from version to version, so that it takes up much
    less space than the corresponding set of versions. Access to versions
    is through a command "check out" and a new version is incorporated
    into this file through a command "check in".</p>
  <p>
    The set of all ",v" files used for an application is called its "repository".
    The repository is structured as a hierarchy of directories, just like
    the sources for the application would be.</p>
  <p>
    You never touch the repository except through commands given to CVS.</p>
  <p>
    Normally you will start work by checking out of the repository a complete
    set of source files into your private work space. CVS will extract
    the sources and create the necessary directory structure in your space.</p>
  <p>
    Development can then go on independently of any other person working
    on the same version: each developer has his own private copies.</p>
  <p>
    When you have work ready, you will check in your files: CVS will incorporate
    the changes of all modified files into the repository as a new version.</p>
  <p>
    More important: when a different developer has checked in some work
    (e.g. a bug fix), you can incorporate that into your current work
    *without* having to check in, by the "update" operation. Developers
    synchronise once in a while through updates.</p>
  <p>
    There are also various means of identifying important versions.
  </p>
  <h2>WWW installation</h2>
  The directory CVSROOT is where CVS stores its bookkeeping files.
  <p>
    The directory CVSRepository is where CVS stores the sources in the
    RCS format, i.e. one file for all versions and branches of each source
    file.</p>
  <p>
    Please do not touch CVSROOT nor CVSRepository, they are to be maintained
    by use of CVS commands only.
  </p>

    the "standard" sources: prep.ai.mit.edu.)</p>
