  Jyrki Kuoppala <jkp> suggests both using the texinfo reader
    as a base for a browser, and also uconverting texinfo documents into
    html.

      I recently came across a hypertext book on umn-cs.cs.umn.edu
      directory /pub/gnu/hypertext which is intended for use
      with Emacs.
      Can anyone tell me
      a) if there is a *full* description of the encoding for such files;
      preferably from some ftp host.
      (actually it was not hard to interpret these files).
      b) if there are other documents encoded this way and where these
      can be obtained from.
      thank you for your support
      best wishes, Gerhard Gonter

    re hypertext and Emacs, as mentioned in another reply INFO mode is
    really hypertextual; there is an informal project to make it easier
    to write and edit INFO documents, called "Para Mode"; for further
    information, you may want to get on the Para mailing list (send requests
    to "Para-request@cs.cmu.edu", or postings to "para@cs.cmu.edu"). 
    Para mode is by Bob Chassell of the FSF.  The Para archives are at
    ipl.rpi.edu (though note that configuration changes recently have
    occasionally knocked the ipl machine off the nets).  The hypertextual
    book may be the draft by Roy Rada of Liverpool, which was posted to
    the Para list a year or so ago, I speculate....
