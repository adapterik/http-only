  on CERNVM are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>Yellow pages information is not very complete.
    </li>
    <li>The use of many levels of heading instead of DL lists is unfortunate
      when it comes to formating. DESY (etc) would like the lists coming
      back from XFIND to have the "EXP line" aligned -- perhaps we need
      a DL 
    </li>
    <li>The title generated for a coument contains only the EXP: line. In
      many cases this is written on the assumption that it will always be
      preceded by the name line.
    </li>
  </ul>
