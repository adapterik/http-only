  <h1>Introduction of CVS</h1>
  <h2>Aug 3 -- to keep in mind:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>change directory structure only if necessary,
    </li>
    <li>change makefiles only if necessary
    </li>
    <li>develop a script that can change links in a set of .html files to
      a new value (since some source files are referred to from the documentation.)
    </li>
    <li>if 'src' is used by ASIS and the CERN Library, and 'implementation'
      is used only by us, then we should get rid of 'implementation'
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>aug 7 -- what about...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>why do we need "extern" in front of function prototypes?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>aug 10</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>more experiments with CVS give good feeling (except that we did not
      manage to remove a file). When a developer requests an update for
      a file of which he has a copy "A", CVS looks at the original version
      "O" that he checked out AND at the latest version "L" (as checked
      in by the other developer). If "L" differs from "O" in a part where
      "O" and "A" are the same, then that difference is propagated into
      "A". If  "L" differs from "O" in a part where "A" also differs from
      "O". then that is a conflict. It is marked in "A" and a backup of
      the original "A" (before the update" is put in ".#A".
    </li>
  </ul>
