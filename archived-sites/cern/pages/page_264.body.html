  <h1>Guide</h1>
  The Guide product is marketed by <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/265" original-href="OWL.html" archive-page-id="265">OWL</a> , though originally developed
  in the research environment (under unix) by <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/266" original-href="../../Conferences/ECHT90/People.html#pbrown" archive-page-id="266">Peter Brown</a> .
  <p>
    The OWL version runs on Macs and PCs using WINDOWS/3 though a beta
    test version running on unix using X exists. Maybe we could test it.</p>

    IDEX is a product which uses Guide but includes (in the same program)
    a document manger with full text search capability. It runs on PCs,
    and uses existing remote file access mechanisms to allow a distributed
    system. The documentation manger creates UIDs, and will convert a
    UID into a path.

  <h2><a name="2">Transfer format</a></h2>
  Guide uses an SGML DTD they call HML. This would be very interesting
  to compare with HyTime's efforts, and WWW's "HTML".</div>
