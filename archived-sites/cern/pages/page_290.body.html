<div data-element="archive-body">
  <h1>Test Dataset</h1>
  This is an example bit of hypertext - compare  the formatted version
  with the <a name="10" href="/archive/cern/1058" original-href="test_source.txt" archive-page-id="1058">original HTML source</a>. Let's try introducing an initial paragrpah
  between the H1 and the H2 headings.
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  This file contains a test set of HTML mark-up, as a test of hypertext
  browsers and an example of the syntax of the tags. See also:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/1059">An arbitrary news article</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/35">The newsgroup on hypertext</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/2" original-href="../TheProject.html" archive-page-id="2">More details about the WWW project.</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  That is the end of the list.
  <h2>Some anchors</h2>
  Anchors come in two forms: whole nodes or parts of nodes. The line
  mode browser can't currently (Nov 91)  jump to a part of a node: it
  always jumps to the top.
  <h3>Leading to whole nodes</h3>
  Here is an anchor which leads to <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/1060">the VM FIND command.</a> Note the nested
  highlighting (hp2) within the anchor. If you want to click on <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/322" original-href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/default.html" archive-page-id="322">this,</a>
  you will go to the system default page.
  <h3>Leading to anchors within nodes</h3>
  Now <a name="5" href="#2">THIS</a> leads to anchor #2 in this file, and if you want to click
  on <a name="6" href="/archive/cern/322" original-href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/default.html#2" archive-page-id="322">THIS,</a> you should go to the system default page with anchor #2 selected.
  Now the word <a name="dest1">"destination"</a> is a named destination anchor, connected
  to the word <a name="7" href="#dest1">"source"</a> . Clicking on the destination shouldn't do anything.
  Selecting the source should lead to the destination.
  <p>
    Now let's go through the limited set of markup tags which we accept.
    The title, "Hypertext HTML formatting example" was between TITLE tags.
    "Test Dataset" at the top of this page was a Level One Heading (H1).
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. In Hertford, Hereford
    and hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen.
  </p>
  <h2>Level two heading</h2>
  Here is some text which follows the heading. The quick brown fox jumps
  over the lazy dog. In Hertford, Hereford and hampshire, hurricanes
  hardly happen.
  <h3>Level 3 heading</h3>
  Here is some text which follows the heading. The quick brown fox jumps
  over the lazy dog. In Hertford, Hereford and hampshire, hurricanes
  hardly happen.
  <p>
    This is a test paragraph. It is separated from the previous one by
    a P paragraph mark.</p>
  <p>
    This new paragraph was separated from the previous one by a blank
    line, a horrible leftover from SCRIPT, which violates the free format
    of the text.</p>
  <p>
    This was delimited in the same way in the source. The blank line should
    have the same effect as a paragraph mark. We have included in HTML
    some tags from the SGML tagset used at and once supported at CERN
    by<a name="8" href="/archive/cern/1061"> quite a lot of documentation and SGML examples.</a> The HTML parser
    will ignore tags which it does not understand, and will ignore attributes
    which it does not understand of CERN-SGML tags. Of course, the HTML
    parser will not accept any commands in the<a name="9" href="/archive/cern/1062"> SCRIPT</a> language.</p>
  <p>
    Now for an example section, in monospaced font:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    _-_
    [o,o]
    \-/
    This text is laid out using fixed-width characters
    -----------
    It uses the After the example text, we revert to the default again.
    Now lets us try out a glossary. A glossary has a large hanging indent
    aligned with a first tab stop.
  </xmp>
  <pre><xmp> tag, and can contain embedded &lt; and &gt; signs. It has
   tabs every eight columns like good old simple systems we know and love.

</xmp><pre></pre>
  <h3>Glossary</h3>
</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Glossary
  </dt>
  <dd> A list of definitions of terms. Each term is given in a left-hand
    column, with a longer textual definition being given in a right-hand
    column.
  </dd>
  <dt>Term
  </dt>
  <dd> A word or phrase being defined.
  </dd>
  <dt>Definition
  </dt>
  <dd> A sentences or sentences which define the term. the definition
    can wrap around in the second column, but the term can't wrap around
    in the second column.
  </dd>
</dl>
And after that dazzling display of formatting, how about  an unordered
list:
<ul>
  <li>This is the first element of an unordered list
  </li>
  <li>This is the 2nd element of an unordered list
  </li>
  <li>This is the 3rd element of an unordered list
  </li>
  <li>This is the 4th element of an unordered list
  </li>
</ul>
Now let's try a "MENU" section. It's the same as a list but intended for single-line sized entities, not too spaced out. It could be a browser panel.
<menu>
  <li>This is the first element of a menu
  </li>
  <li>This is the 2nd element of a menu
  </li>
  <li>This is the 3rd element of a menu
  </li>
  <li>This is the 4th element of a menu
  </li>
</menu>
Now let's try a "DIR" section. It's the same, but elements are expected to be smaller and to be arranged in columns.
<dir>
  <li>First element of directory
  </li>
  <li>This is the 2nd element
  </li>
  <li>Third</li>
  <li>fouth</li>
  <li>fifth</li>
  <li>sixth element of a directory
  </li>
  <li>This is the 7th element of directory
  </li>
</dir>
Now let's try a "LISTING" section. The tabs should be every 8 spaces.
<listing>
  123456781234567812345678123456781234567812345678123456781234567812345678123456781234567
  !	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!
  Column:	First	Second	Third	Fourth	Fifth	Sixth	Seventh	Eighth	Ninth	Tenth
  Index:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
  Junk:	The	Quick	borwn	fox	jumps	over	the	lazy	dog	again!
</listing>This is the end of the test file.</div>
