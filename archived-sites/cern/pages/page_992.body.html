  <h1>RARE WORKING GROUP 3</h1>
  <h2>1.   INTRODUCTION</h2>
  RARE (Reseaux Associes pour la Recherche Europeenne) is the association
  of users and providers of European research oriented networks.  RARE
  Working Group 3 (WG3) was set up in order to coordinate and harmonise
  the collection and provision of information of use to the member bodies
  of RARE.WG3 comprises two subgroups:
  <ul>
    <li>The User Support and Information Services subgroup (USIS);
    </li>
    <li>The Directory Services subgroup (DS).
    </li>
  </ul>
  Members of the group are national representatives, typically one per
  subgroup nominated by the national RARE contacts, and invited experts
  including representatives from European-wide research networks. All
  members contribute to the work of WG3 on a voluntary basis.
  <p>
    The work of the group is closely related to that of the other RARE
    Working Groups.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Working Group meets 3 to 4 times a year to discuss actual developments
    and future work items related to the activities mentioned in its terms
    of reference.  Outside these meetings discussions and document preparation
    and revision takes place by E-mail through distribution lists.</p>
