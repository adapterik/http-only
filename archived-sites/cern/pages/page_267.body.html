  <h1>DynaText</h1>
  DynaText is a <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/34" original-href="../Overview.html" archive-page-id="34">hypertext system</a> based on SGML and a large number of
  Graphics standards. It comes from <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/268" original-href="EBT.html" archive-page-id="268">Electronic Book Technology</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Basically portable,  posix/X conforming.
    </li>
    <li>Uses SGML format for document storage
    </li>
    <li>Large variety of graphics formats
    </li>
    <li>Full text indexing included.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Dynatext is now available for Suns - (os4.1 or higher, 10MB nnedeed
  for full installation), on Sun-2  3.5"floppies or cartdidge. Production
  version 1 now available (March 91).  Mr. Schmidt is getting us one
  on cartirdge (13 March 1991). Evaluation price for 45 days: SFr750
  (CERN half price). Under evaluation.
  <p>
    Aparently Windows-3 version is avilable beta test only - Chris jones
    has one.
  </p>
  <h2>First impressions</h2>
  We (Giuseppe Mornacchi and I) installed the product on a sun4 running
  openlook, but noticed that the motif version supplied with it works
  fine (even under openlook).
  <p>
    The first disappointment with dynatext was that it is not an authoring
    system. It requires SGML to be prepared in advance. It then builds
    a book with it, which involves building indexes etc. After this process,
    the book can be browsed. </p>
  <p>
    A strange feature is that the licencing is done on builds: each time
    you rebuild a book, your license is decremented! Therefore, it is
    not really suitable for fast-changing cooperative work: it is targetted
    at centralised publication. </p>
  <p>
    The browsing is basically good, very similar to DEC's bookreader product.
    One can have more than one window on hte same document, but by default
    following a link replaces the text in the window one has.
  </p>
  <h3>Searching</h3>
  I found searching difficult at first, because one needs access to
  three windows at a time.  The table of contents window starts the
  search, a lookup window has the parameters, and the results are highlighted
  in the text window.  As under openlook I found I was always losing
  windows on the screen, it would take me some time to find the results
  of my search. The default positions for the table of contents and
  lookup windows seem to be on top of each other, which didn't help.
  Windows do not pop to the surface when something interesting happens
  in them.
  <p>
    The search result is neat, however, in that the contents page is annotated
    with the number of occurences of the pattern in each chapter, section,
    etc. (The contents page is an outline viewer which allows contraction
    and expansion of the nesting).
  </p>
  <h3>Links</h3>
  Links are not represented by highlighted text, but by icons in the
  margin (in the case of the documents we read, the right hand margin,
  but this is defined in a style sheet.)  This involved the use of macros
  (SGML entities) for phrases like "see table linked at right" for the
  browsable version, but "see table below" for the printed version.
  This meant that the flow of the text was broken by such references,
  so in practise the document only contained a few links.  In their
  example documentation, this was infuriating: there would be a reference
  to another part of the document in the text, but no link to it!
  <p>
    There are links within and between documents. One can, in the DTD,
    specify the effect of a link using a number of predefined "scripts".
    I don't know how flexible this is and whether it would allow us to
    add WWW-style networking capability.
  </p>
  <h3>General</h3>
  As authoring is not supported, neither is annotation, though I understand
  from EBT that a future version will support annotation (only - not
  full authoring).
  <p>
    There was a steady chatter to the standard error output of little
    error messages, which didn't seem to affect anything visible in the
    windows.</p>
  <p>
    Out attempts to get a wider test public by displaying  dynatext on
    a Vaxstation running the (field test) X11R4/Motif failed: the font
    "fixed" could not be found. We put the blame for this on DEC rather
    than EBT.</p>
  <p>
    Interesting possibilities for Cern would hinge on someone producing
    the DTDs and style sheets for CERN SGML files and/or WWW HTML files.
    Perhaps the LHC test beam team will have time to try this.</p>
