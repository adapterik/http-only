  I just put my tty-based browser up
  for ftp.  This is a Beta release
  (I guess I'll find out just how beta
  it is :-).  It's written in perl,
  so you may also need to pick up perl.
  <p>
    You can get the browser via ftp from
    archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, in pub/w3browser/w3browser-0.1.shar.</p>
  <p>
    It's a shar file, so unpack with
  </p>
  <pre>			sh w3browser-0.1.shar

</pre>
  and it will create files in your
  current directory.
  <p>
    I've included my own version of termcap.pl
    (normally a standard perl distribution
    file, I think), because I found a
    bug in ours.  I'll check after thanksgiving
    to see if there's a more recent version
    with an official bug fix.</p>
  <p>
    Use, enjoy, comment, and flame.</p>
