<div data-element="archive-body">
  <h1>Information and Overviews</h1>
  There are two types of information you can get: the information and
  the overview (see <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/3782" original-href="MovingAround.html" archive-page-id="3782">Moving Around</a> ). To get these use the `info' and
  `overview' commands. Both commands can be used on the same item. For
  example, to get all the information on the DFN network use the following
  commands:
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Networks/dfn
    overview
    info
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  There will be two parts to the message that is sent back to you. The
  first is the overview, and the second is the information itself. You
  do not have to send both these commands together, they could be sent
  separately like this:
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Networks/dfn
    overview
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  and like this:
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Networks/dfn
    info
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
