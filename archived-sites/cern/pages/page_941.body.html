  <h1>HyperText and Information Retrieval</h1>
  There was a <a name="0" href="/archive/cern/903" original-href="Programme.html#pan7" archive-page-id="903">panel</a> on this topic at ECHT90. Some (IR) peopele maintained
  that nothing in HT was substantially new, and some (HT) people maintained
  that HT was significantly different. This was, in some ways, a fairly
  pointless discussion. There seemed to be a consensus that both conventional
  IR techniques (such as full text searches) and hypertext-style linking
  from sensitive areas would be needed, and many products in fact combine
  both flavours. The HT people were in general better at making sexy
  front end systems, while they had nothing much to add to the IR community's
  back-end algorithms.

    However, it is obvious that whatever the underlying indexing and link
    support, one must make the user interface as consistent as possible.
    A nice example of this is the <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/270" original-href="../../Products/Microcosm/Microcosm.html#GenericLinking" archive-page-id="270"> generic linking </a>concept of Microcosm,
    picked up also by the <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/1033" original-href="Perseus.html" archive-page-id="1033">Perseus project</a> .</p>

    The WWW project alows <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/940" original-href="../../WWW/DesignIssues/ManyIndexes.html" archive-page-id="940">many indexes</a> to exist within a hypertext web.
    It represents the results of an index search as hypertext, so using
    the a single model </p>
