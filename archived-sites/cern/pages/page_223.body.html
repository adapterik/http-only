  <h1>Things to be done</h1>
  There are many of these ...if you have a moment, take your pick! Some
  of these would make good projects, or would be a way your organization
  could contribute to the building of the web.
  <p>
    There are also special lists of little things to do for each existing
    project such as the <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/155" original-href="LineMode/Defaults/Bugs.html" archive-page-id="155">line mode browser</a> , the <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/160" original-href="NeXT/Implementation/Bugs.html" archive-page-id="160">NeXT browser</a> , the common<a name="5" href="/archive/cern/742" original-href="Library/Bugs.html" archive-page-id="742">
      library</a> , and the <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/740" original-href="Daemon/Bugs.html" archive-page-id="740">server</a> .
  </p>
  <h2>Client side</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>More clients
    </dt>
    <dd> Clients exist for many platforms, but not all. Editors
      only exist on the NeXT, but will be really useful for sourcing info
      and group work. (Group editor?)
    </dd>
    <dt>Search engines
    </dt>
    <dd> Now the web of data and indexes exists, some really
      smart intelligent algorithms ("knowbots?") could run on it.  Recursive
      index and link tracing, Just think...
    </dd>
    <dt>Text from hypertext
    </dt>
    <dd> We need a quick way to print a book from the web.
      (A simple method using TeX exists)
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Server side</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Server upgrade
    </dt>
    <dd> Easier to install, port.  Export directories as hypertext.
      Run shell scripts embedded in the directory for virtual documents
      and searches.
    </dd>
    <dt>More Servers
    </dt>
    <dd> See the <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/246" original-href="../DataSources/Overview.html" archive-page-id="246">list</a> of things we have thought of or been pointed
      to.
    </dd>
    <dt>WAIS integration
    </dt>
    <dd> WAIS protocol extensions to allow hypertext; HTML
      data type, docids to be conforming UDIs. Integrate WAIS in client
      too.
    </dd>
    <dt>Integrate client and server
    </dt>
    <dd> A client which generates HTML becomes
      a general purpose gateway. Especially useful for sites where general
      access to news, external internet, etc, is limited.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Other software</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Gateways
    </dt>
    <dd> JANET and DECnet for example. Real need.
    </dd>
    <dt>HTTP enhancements
    </dt>
    <dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
      information for statistics.
    </dd>
    <dt>Mail manager
    </dt>
    <dd> A hypertext view of a mail archive with lists of messages
      by author, topic, with links between messages. A friendly face on
      a mail archive would be a great project management tool.
    </dd>
    <dt>HTTP enhancements
    </dt>
    <dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
      information for statistics.
    </dd>
    <dt>Form processing
    </dt>
    <dd> If you can edit hypertext, you edit a hypertext form
      and return it.   To be able to submit a form back to the server would
      allow  special search patterns, administrative processing, electronic
      voting, ...
    </dd>
    <dt>Graphic overview
    </dt>
    <dd> Display the web from any document in a graphical
      form.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Tutorials
    </dt>
    <dd> Hypertext leading a new or prospective user through W3.
    </dd>
    <dt>Canned demos
    </dt>
    <dd> A hypertext path through some good represenattive places
      to visit. Maybe a script to make a timed presentation (with sound?).
    </dd>
    <dt> Videos
    </dt>
    <dd> Would save us giving so many talks!
    </dd>
    <dt>Policy documents
    </dt>
    <dd>Statements on NIR: collect from institutes, provide
      background for organizations making NIR policy decisions.
    </dd>
  </dl>
