  <h1>HTML directions</h1>
  The <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/38" original-href="MarkUp.html" archive-page-id="38">HTML language</a> has been in use
  in the field since 1990, and several
  suggestions have been made for improvements.
  See <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/188" original-href="../WorkingNotes/Overview.html" archive-page-id="188">working notes</a> . A new <a name="37" href="/archive/cern/287" original-href="SGML.html#5" archive-page-id="287">DTD</a> will
  be the result.
  <h2>Bad HTML</h2>
  Much of the HTML actually around
  has been generated by the NeXTStep
  editor, which has in fact generated
  bad HTML. This should not confuse
  the specification.   Some bugs in
  that output include non-matching
  open and close tags, and a NEXTID
  tag  which is not SGML. Also, attribute
  values are not quoted even when they
  contain characters which require
  them to be quoted in SGML.
  <p>
    A<a name="38" href="/archive/cern/203" original-href="../Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl" archive-page-id="203"> perl script</a> was written by Dan
    Connolly to clean up bad HTML.  </p>
  <p>
    Also, see Dan's <a name="z41" href="/archive/cern/294" original-href="Connolly/MarkUp.html" archive-page-id="294">HTML spec</a> (draft)
    which contains a sort of test suite.
  </p>
  <h2>New features</h2>
  Please mail me mentioning this list
  if you think of features I have missed
  out.
  <h2>Header</h2>
  A wrapper element for all the document-wide
  information such as title, document-wide
  links, etc. Advantage: You know when
  you have got to the end of it, and
  can open a window with the required
  attributes. This is easier than checking
  for a printable character.
  <p>
    Disadvantage: If mandatory, the size
    of the minimum document is increased.</p>
  <p>
    A "Body" tag might be useful in the
    same light, for the rest.
  </p>
  <h2>Link</h2>
  A document-wide link, as distinct
  from a localized anchor. Mainly useful
  in conjunction with interesting link
  types such as related-index, related-glossary,
  parent, author,  print-with, copy-with,
  etc.
  <p>
    An empty element.</p>
  <p>
    Atributes are as for the anchor element.
  </p>
  <h2>Dates</h2>
  A tag giving the dates a document
  was created, modified and expired
  is going to be essential for caching
  systems.
  <p>
    The expiry date-time will allow long
    cache times for documents such as
    RFCs, and short or zero caching times
    for varing data.</p>
  <p>
    &lt;DATE CREATED="920630123067" EXPIRES="920706000000"&gt;</p>
  <p>
    (Is there an SGML standard for datetimes?
    Which standard to use standard? HyTime?)
  </p>
  <h2>Highlighting</h2>
  The HPx elements are not implemented.
  Some bold/italic/fixed width highlighting
  is useful, with equivalent representations
  on single font devices. Three possibilities
  are
  <dl>
    <dt>Numbered HPn tags
    </dt>
    <dd> These are rather
      meaningless. In practice, everyone
      has to remember which is bold and
      which is italic.
    </dd>
    <dt>Logical tags.
    </dt>
    <dd> Dan: "I'd prefer &lt;em&gt;,
      &lt;tt&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, ala TeX. Or we could
      go with the O'Reilly/Hal DocBook
      tags: &lt;Emphasis&gt;, &lt;OopsChar&gt;, &lt;wordasword&gt;,&lt;CiteBook&gt;,&lt;Subscript&gt;,
      &lt;Superscript&gt;". A problem is there
      are never enough of them, so people
      reuse them on the understanding that
      they will be bold, etc.
    </dd>
    <dt>Physical tags:
    </dt>
    <dd> &lt;Bold&gt;, &lt;italic&gt; etc
      as in MIME. There would have to be
      an understanding that equivalent
      representations could be substituted
      where bold and italic are not available.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Base address</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>savedas 
    </dt>
    <dd>Could be a name for the tag
      to give the address with which the
      document was saved, so that relative
      links could be resolved even when
      a document is found out of context
      (like mailed).
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Fixed width text with anchors etc</h2>
  The XMP and LISTING elements have
  proved essential for putting on line
  text already formatted assuming a
  fixed-width character set. Many people
  have asked for a version which, instead
  of being oblivious to any embedded
  elements, added elements, ang and
  anchors withing the text. Line end
  would have to be mareked as such
  (with P) so that marked-up a line
  could be represented on many lines:
  the markup could make it too long
  to send as it was, and very inconvenient.
  <p>
    Note that an editor could always
    save in this element something which
    was originally loaded as a raw text
    section: indeed, the raw text is
    really only a (very useful!) way
    of importing text which could also
    go though a filter to make it valid
    marked up SGML.
  </p>
  <h2>Fixed width indented</h2>
  Very often one wants to quote a command
  in fixed width font, but indented
  as a quotation, say 40 characters
  wide rather than 80.  Perhaps the
  width required should be a parameter
  to the fixed width with anchors element.
  (Smacks of low-level format!) 
  <h2>Ordered list</h2>
  Perhaps the OL tag ought to go back
  in, to distinguish the ordered list
  from the unordered one. Dan Conolly
  implements it.
  <h2>Link types</h2>
  There is a <a name="39" href="/archive/cern/852" original-href="../DesignIssues/LinkTypes.html" archive-page-id="852">list of link types</a> . We
  should formalize these, and then
  people actually could implement them.
  This corresponds to giving values
  to the <a name="40" href="/archive/cern/286" original-href="Tags.html#21" archive-page-id="286">TYPE attribute</a> .  This attribute
  cohis attribute coEL for RELATIONSHIP
  to avoid confusion between the type
  of link and the type of object to
  which it points.
  <h2>Entities</h2>
  A full set of entities for specical
  charecters should be defined, picked
  out of a suitable standard table.
  This should allow for accented characeters
  and bullets as a minimum.  Representation
  using regular USASCII stand-ins (such
  as oe for o umlaut) should be allowed
  where the full character sets are
  not available.  Editors must preserve
  entities even when the display has
  defaulted to a stand-in character
  combination.
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  The ability to hide information in
  an SGML document is useful. The COMMENT
  entity was introduced for this purpose
  in the line mode browser as an experiment.
  It should go in as standard in future.
  If it can contain anything then it
  can be used for commenting things
  out.
