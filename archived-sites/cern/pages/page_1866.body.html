  <h1>Profile elements</h1>
  <h2>AUTH</h2>
  Syntax:
  <xmp>		AUTH WHO=String PWD=String	
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  This specifies the authorisation for the user, giving the user ID
  and password. Note: this ID is not the same as the one used in CLIENT:
  it is possible that the ID is that of a person who happens to use
  the client through a different user.
  <h2>PUBKEY</h2>
  Syntax:
  <xmp>		PUBKEY KEY=String	
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Public key, in case the server wants to encrypt data before sending
  it. See a very good summary of public-key cryptosystems in practice,
  including key certification issues, in the <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/4061" original-href="../../../PGP/pgpguide.doc" archive-page-id="4061">documentation of PGP</a> .
  <h2>CLIENT</h2>
  Information about the person requesting the data, the user ID (which
  may be different from the authorisation user ID), the host (s)he's
  on, the email address and the organisation worked for. The syntax
  is
  <xmp>
    CLIENT ID=String HOST=String EMAIL=String ORG=String 
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  <dl>
    <dt>ID
    </dt>
    <dd> represents the user on the given host.
    </dd>
    <dt>HOST
    </dt>
    <dd> The full domain name of the host machine on which the client
      program is running.
    </dd>
    <dt>EMAIL
    </dt>
    <dd> The contact address for the client. Optional.
    </dd>
    <dt>ORG
    </dt>
    <dd> The text of the client's affiliation. Optional.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  [JFG] Perhaps use standard RFC-822 fields ? X.500 needed again !
  <p>
    I like the EMAIL field: servers can do some direct marketing :-) More
    seriously, inform their regular users on data updates, discount rates,
    change of public key, ... [RC: in other words, junk-hypertext. Forbidden
    in Germany? :-)  ]
  </p>
  <h2>FORMAT</h2>
  <xmp>		FORMAT 
    NAME=String PENALTY=String
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Describes a format the client can accept, and the penalty. Multiple
  instances of  FORMAT add them to a list of acceptable formats.
  <p>
    See <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/1049" original-href="../../Protocols/Penalties.html" archive-page-id="1049">Rules for penalty calculation</a> .
  </p>
  <h2>SOFTWARE</h2>
  <xmp>		SOFTWARE PLATFORM=String PROGRAM=String VERSION=String 
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Information about the client software: the platform it's being run
  on, the program being used and its version.
  <p>
    Allows servers to adapt to the "market".</p>
