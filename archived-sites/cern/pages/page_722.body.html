  <h1>Using Anonymous FTP</h1>
  Anonymous FTP access means  using the <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/184" original-href="../Protocols/RelevantProtocols.html#11" archive-page-id="184">FTP protocol</a> with username "anonymous"
  and a password which is the reader's mail address. It is a conventional
  way of publishing material on the internet.
  <p>
    It allows anyone on the internet (or gatewayed network) to access
    a SUBSET of your files. On a unix system, this involves setting up
    a user "ftp" in whse home directory the public files will be. An external
    user sees a file system whose root is that home directory. Look at
    the man page for ftpd on your system. </p>
  <p>
    Normally, the public files are kept in /pub or a subdirectory of that.</p>
  <p>
    Any file with which is accesible using anonymous ftp is accesible
    as a W3 document with address
  </p>
  <xmp>			file://node.domain/path/path/path
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  for (imaginary) example
  <xmp>			file://info.cern.ch/pub/README.txt
  </xmp>
