  <h1>HTTP as implemented in WWW</h1>
  This document defines the Hypertext
  Transfer protocol  (HTTP) as currently
  implemented by the <a name="15" href="/archive/cern/2" original-href="../../TheProject.html" archive-page-id="2">WorldWideWeb</a> initaitive
  software. This is a subset of the
  <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/282" original-href="../HTTP.html" archive-page-id="282">proposed</a> full HTTP protocol.  No
  client profile information is transferred
  with the query. Future HTTP protocols
  will be back-compatible with this
  protocol.
  <p>
    The definition of this protocol is
    in the public domain (see <a name="16" href="/archive/cern/9" original-href="../../Policy.html" archive-page-id="9">policy</a>
    ).</p>
  <p>
    The protocol  uses the normal internet-style
    telnet protocol style on a TCP-IP
    link. The following describes how
    a client acquires a (hypertext) document
    from an HTTP server, given an HTTP
    document <a name="6" href="/archive/cern/283" original-href="../../Addressing/HTTPAddressing.html" archive-page-id="283">address</a> .
  </p>
  <h2>Connection</h2>
  The client makes a TCP-IP connection
  to the host using the <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/284" original-href="../../Addressing/BNF.html#5" archive-page-id="284">domain name</a>
  or <a name="8" href="/archive/cern/284" original-href="../../Addressing/BNF.html#45" archive-page-id="284">IP number</a> , and the <a name="9" href="/archive/cern/284" original-href="../../Addressing/BNF.html#7" archive-page-id="284">port number</a>
  given in the address.
  <p>
    If the port number is not specified,
    80 is always assumed for HTTP.</p>
  <p>
    The server accepts the connection.</p>
  <p>
    Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP,
    but could run over any connection-oriented
    service.   The interpretation of
    the protocol below in the case of
    a sequenced packet service (such
    as DECnet(TM) or ISO TP4) is that
    that the request should be one TPDU,
    but the response may be many.
  </p>
  <h2>Request</h2>
  The client sends a document request
  consisting of a line of ASCII characters
  terminated by a CR LF (carriage return,
  line feed) pair. A well-behaved server
  will not require the carriage return
  character.
  <p>
    This request consists of the word
    "GET", a space, the <a name="10" href="/archive/cern/284" original-href="../../Addressing/BNF.html#1" archive-page-id="284">document address</a>
    , omitting the "http:, host and port
    parts when they are the coordinates
    just used to make the connection.
    (If a gateway is being used, then
    a full document address may be given
    specifying a different naming scheme).</p>
  <p>
    The search functionality of the protocol
    lies in the ability of the addressing
    syntax to describe a <a name="14" href="/archive/cern/285" original-href="../../Addressing/Search.html" archive-page-id="285">search on a
      named index</a> .</p>
  <p>
    A search should only be requested
    by a client when the index document
    itself has been descibed as an index
    using the  <a name="12" href="/archive/cern/286" original-href="../../MarkUp/Tags.html#18" archive-page-id="286">ISINDEX tag</a> .
  </p>
  <h2>Response</h2>
  The response to a simple GET request
  is a message in hypertext mark-up
  language (<a name="11" href="/archive/cern/38" original-href="../../MarkUp/MarkUp.html" archive-page-id="38"> HTML</a> ). This is a byte
  stream of ASCII characters. 
  <p>
    Lines shall be delimited by an optional
    carriage return followed by a mandatory
    line feed chararcter. The client
    should not assume that the carriage
    return will be present.  Lines may
    be of any length. Well-behaved servers
    should retrict line length to 80
    characters excluding the CR LF pair.</p>
  <p>
    The format of the message is HTML
    - that is, a trimmed SGML document.
    Note that this format allows for
    menus and hit lists to be returned
    as hypertext. It also allows for
    plain ASCII text to be returned following
    the  <a name="13" href="/archive/cern/286" original-href="../../MarkUp/Tags.html#7" archive-page-id="286">PLAINTEXT tag</a> .</p>
  <p>
    The message is terminated by  the
    closing of the connection by the
    server.</p>
  <p>
    Well-behaved clients will read the
    entire document as fast as possible.
    The client shall not wait for user
    action (output paging for example)
    before reading the whole of the document.
    The server may impose a timeout
    of the order of 15 seconds on inactivity.</p>
  <p>
    Error responses are supplied in human
    readable text in HTML syntax. There
    is no way to distinguish an error
    response from a satisfactory response
    except for the content of the text.
  </p>
  <h2>Disconnection</h2>
  The TCP-IP connection is broken by
  the server when the whole document
  has been transferred.
  <p>
    The client may abort the transfer
    by breaking the connection before
    this, in which case the server shall
    not record any error condition.</p>
  <p>
    Requests are <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/282" original-href="../HTTP.html#13" archive-page-id="282">idempotent</a> .  The server
    need not store any information about
    the request after disconnection.</p>
