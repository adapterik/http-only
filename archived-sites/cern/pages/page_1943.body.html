  <h1>Unix "path"</h1>
  This is the set of directories which the system looks in for executable
  files.  You can find out what your path is by the command
  <xmp>			echo $path
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Normally the path is set by a command in your <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/1944" original-href="LoginScript.html" archive-page-id="1944">login shell script</a> .
  Remember that if you change your path, then you must type
  <xmp>			rehash
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  so that the shell rebuilds the set of executable files which it will
  accept as commands.
