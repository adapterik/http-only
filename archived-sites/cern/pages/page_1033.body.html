  This is a very complete hypertext on classical Greek civilisation, which incorporates
  philological, archaeological and historical views of the topic.
  It was presented in the penultimate <a href="/archive/cern/903" original-href="Programme.html#pap9" archive-page-id="903"> paper session
    of ECHT90 by its editor in chief, </a><a href="/archive/cern/266" original-href="People.html#Mylonas" archive-page-id="266">Elli Mylonas</a>.
  <p>
    Examples of date held on the Perseus CDROM are original Greek texts with a parallel
    scrolling English translation, maps of ancient sites, and photographs of archeological remains.

  <p>
    The Perseus data is stored in SGML, and as postscript and colour slides, and converted
    for distribution into Hypercard form, with some loss of information.
    Links are generated in a similar manner to the <a href="/archive/cern/1997" original-href="../../Products/Microcosm.html" archive-page-id="1997">Microcosm</a> generic keyword system.
    The disks are being shipped to various sites for trial use by students.
