  <h1>Why a new protocol?</h1>
  Existing protocols cover a number of different tasks.
  <ul>
    <li>Mail protocols allow the transfer of transient messages from a single
      author to a small number of recipients, at the request of the author.
    </li>
    <li>File transfer protocols allow the transfer of data at the request
      of either the sender or receiver, but allow little processing of the
      data at the responding side.
    </li>
    <li>News protocols allow the broadcast of transient data to a wide audience.
    </li>
    <li>Search and Retrieve protocols allow index searches to be made, and
      allow document access. Few exist: Z39.50 is one and could be extended
      for our needs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  The protocol we need  for information access (<a name="1" href="/archive/cern/282" original-href="HTTP.html#2" archive-page-id="282"> HTTP</a> ) must provide
  <ul>
    <li>A subset of the file transfer functionality
    </li>
    <li>The ability to request an index search
    </li>
    <li>Automatic format negotiation.
    </li>
    <li>The ability to refer the client to another server
    </li>
  </ul>
