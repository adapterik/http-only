    IRIS is a 20-strong institute which is part of Brown University. It
    is funded by external grants, although its members are salaried staff
    of the university. IRIS developed the <a name="0" href="../../../../Products/Intermedia/Intermedia.html">Intermedia</a> product as a research
    tool, and now sell it in versions to run on Apple A/UX version 1 only.
    They are not pursuing Intermedia as a product. They have their own
    unix version for research, which is available to sponsors.</p>
  <p>
    IRIS have discussed hypermedia with several manufacturers, encouraging
    them to adopt certain <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/979" original-href="../../Conferences/ECHT90/Tutorial6.html#architecture" archive-page-id="979">architectures</a> for hypermedia. They have developped
    a system of remote objects under C++ (at least, remote method calling,
    not remote objects. Protocol compatible with Sun RPC).</p>
  <p>
    They have a full text indexer, used by <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/980" original-href="../Dynatext/EBT.html" archive-page-id="980">EBT</a> .</p>
  <p>
    IRIS would be interested in collaborative work, if they could find
    some funding through it.</p>
