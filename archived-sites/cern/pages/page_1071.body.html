  <h1>Tolerating broken HTML writers</h1>
  These are illegal according to SGML, but they're so prevalent that
  they're supported by the sample implementation.
  <p>
    Please stop generating HTML in this style!</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2><a name="id1">Document Structure</a></h2>
  The BODY element must start with some element. See: <a href="/archive/cern/2012" original-href="error_data_starts_body.html" archive-page-id="2012">an example document where this rule
    is broken</a>.
  Paragraph breaks are not allowed in headers, lists etc. They may be
  ignored or treated intelligently.
  <ul>
    <li>a list item
      <p>
        with more than one paragraph
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Muti-paragraph</h3>
  <p>
    heading
  </p>
  <h3>Unknown Tags</h3>
  Tags that aren't known to the parser are treated as data by, for
  example, the MidasWWW-1.0 implementation. They should be ignored.
  There should be no tags around the word foo: <unknown>foo</unknown>.
  <h2>Body Elements</h2>
  Note that conforming SGML parsers will treat "&amp;", "&lt;", "&lt;/",
  and "&lt;!" as normal text characters when they are not followed by a
  letter. HTML producers are discouraged from taking advantage of this
  feature.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3><a name="a">Anchors</a></h3>
  <h4>numeric IDs: <a href="#NeXT">NeXT</a> and <a href="/archive/cern/2013" original-href="html-mode" archive-page-id="2013">html-mode.el</a>
  </h4>
  <a name="10">This</a> anchor's name starts with a digit, which is not a
  name start character.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h4>unquoted attribute literals: <a href="#NeXT">NeXT</a> and <a href="/archive/cern/2013" original-href="html-mode" archive-page-id="2013">html-mode.el</a>
  </h4>
  <a href="#NeXT">This anchor</a>'s href contains a '#', which is not a name
  character. It should lead to the NeXT implementation reference below
  anyway. <a href="/archive/cern/2014">This
    anchor</a>'s href
  contains ':' and '/', which are not a name characters. It should lead
  to the SLAC MidasWWW doc anyway.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>Literal Text Elements</h2>
  <h4>Historical Note</h4>
  The original semantics of the XMP and LISTING elements is not
  representable in SGML. From <a href="/archive/cern/286" original-href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html" archive-page-id="286">Tags used in
    HTML</a>:
  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, including
      the tag opener, so long as it does not contain the closing tag in
      full. </li>
  </ul>
  But in section 7.6 of the SGML standard:
  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The content of an element declared to be character data or
      replaceable character data is terminated only by an etago
      delimiter-in-context (which need not open a valid end-tag) ... .
    </li>
  </ul>
  The XMP and LISTING elements are deprecated in favor of the TYPEWRITER
  element.
  <h4>Non-standard CDATA parsing: LineMode, MidasWWW, etc.</h4>
  <xmp>
    This example section ends here: 
    The following systems are known to read and/or write HTML. They all
    have bugs.</xmp>
  <pre><xmp>
Just in case the foo close tag above wasn't recognized:

    The MidasWWW parses HTML into its internal data structures, and
    then offers the option to extract the data and write it to a file.
    It doesn't get it right all the time.
