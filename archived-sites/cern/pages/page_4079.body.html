  <h1>Subdisplays</h1>
  Some type of WHOIS records have associated subdisplays.  They are
  usually offered  interactively to the user - "Would you like to see...?".
  EXPand or '*'  means to always show those subdisplays without asking.
  The opposite, '~'  says not to show them at all. 
  <p>
    Following are the record types which have subdisplays, and what those
    subdisplays are: 
  </p>
  <xmp>	record type		subdisplay
    -------------------	-----------------------------
    host			registered users
    network			hosts on network
    top-level domain	sub-domains under domain
    secondary domain	hosts in secondary domain
    group/organization	registered members
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  The keyword SUBdisplay or '%' can be used to show the subdisplay for
  a record ONLY, without showing the detailed display for the record
  itself.  Instead, a summary of the matching record is shown, and
  then  the subdisplay follows directly. 
  <p>
    Used in conjunction with Full or '=' (e.g. "full sub host SRI-NIC"),
    this provides a means to list out the full record for the users
    of a  host, members of an organzation, etc, instead of having to
    type in  all the handles or names individually. </p>
