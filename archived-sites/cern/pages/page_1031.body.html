  <h1>Glasgow Online</h1>
  This was a very carefully handcrafted 16MB hypertext built
  by <a href="/archive/cern/266" original-href="People.html#baird" archive-page-id="266">Patricia Baird</a> and around 30 others at Strathclyde.
  It is a complete town guide to Glasgow, including maps, and using lots of graphics.
  Uses Hypercard 1. Distributed for 25 pounds to cover the 10 or so disketes if you want one.
