  <h1>Moving around</h1>
  There are two types of information you can get in CONCISE: the first
  is an overview of the information; this sends you a summary, who wrote
  the information, when it was written, and various details of a similar
  nature. The second is the information itself; this is a file (potentially
  large) containing information about the subject in question. The commands
  to get these types of information, `overview' and `info' are discussed
  in 5.4.
  <p>
    The basic way to do anything on the CONCISE service is to go to the
    place, and then perform the action. For example, suppose an overview
    of netnews is required. Netnews is located at /Services/netnews. The
    `goto' command will move you around, the `<a name="0" href="/archive/cern/3784" original-href="Information.html" archive-page-id="3784">overview</a>' command can be
    used to get an overview, so the following commands will retrieve the
    overview on electronic mail:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Services/netnews
    overview
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  A message may have a number of commands in it, so you can move around
  several times in one message. Before CONCISE starts to obey the commands
  you have sent, it puts you at the top of the information, that is
  at one level above COSINE, Networks and Services. From there you can
  go anywhere you want.
  <p>
    Commands that allow movement around the different items are:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>goto
    </dt>
    <dd> goes straight to the item specified;
    </dd>
    <dt>top
    </dt>
    <dd> goes to the top of the information, ie. where you start from;
    </dd>
    <dt>up
    </dt>
    <dd> moves up one level from where you are, eg. if you are at /Services/netnews
      and you use the `up' command, you will got to /Services.</dd>
  </dl>
