  <h1>Darmstadt SGML archive</h1>
  ...This seems to be a good opportunity to bring the <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/287" original-href="../SGML.html" archive-page-id="287">SGML</a> archive at
  Darmstadt (Germany) into mind again. ;-) It should be of interest
  especially for European SGML folks.
  <xmp>	ftp.th-darmstadt.de [130.83.55.75]
    directory pub/text/sgml/
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  All Davenport stuff may be found in pub/text/sgml/davenport. In the
  archive you'll also find free parsers etc.
  <p>
    Most files in this archive are updated automatically each Sunday.
    Ie, if a file/directory is updated at the reference site (here ftp.ora.com)
    it will be available in Darmstadt RSN.</p>
  <p>
    More contributions are welcome. (Advice which TEI-L files to mirror
    would also be of interest -- my time does not allow to work this out
    by myself.) Archive access via mail-server will be available next
    January.
  </p>
  <xmp>Enjoy
