  <h1>HyperText Request</h1>
  This is a language used to specify information about the client to
  the server (for notation, see <a name="8" href="/archive/cern/190" original-href="../Notation.html#1" archive-page-id="190">BNF</a> ).  The information is sent to the
  server after the <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/862" original-href="../Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html#5" archive-page-id="862">GET command line</a> , and is only recognised if the
  format HTRQ has been specified in that command line.
  <p>
    HTRQ specifies information about the client and about the data (in
    the case of PUT)

  <h2><a name="1">ClientInfo</a></h2>
  The profile defines characteristics of the client software and the
  person who runs it.  The syntax is
  <xmp>		PROFILE [KEY=String]
    *ProfileElement
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  See also <a name="9" href="/archive/cern/1866" original-href="HTRQ/Profile.html" archive-page-id="1866">ProfileElements</a> and <a name="12" href="/archive/cern/190" original-href="../Notation.html#3" archive-page-id="190">string</a> .
  <p>
    The key attribute is optional. It is the key returned by the server
    in a previous reply, indicating that the server has stored the profile
    and attached this key to it for future reference by the browser. If
    the key is present, the profile may be empty, but if it is not, then
    it completely replaces the former profile corresponding to the key.</p>
  <p>
    [JFG] Profile keys for frequently accessed servers could also be stored
    at the browser's location in the user's account to save on connection
    time. In that case, there should be some way for the server to determine
    whether the key is still valid, based on time, or when the server
    increases its functionality e.g. by supporting a new data type.</p>
