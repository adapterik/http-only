  You may wish to be told when there is new information, or when something
  is updated. To do this, go to the place of interest and use the `register'
  command. There are two forms of this command: `register update' and
  `register new'. The first is used to tell you when a particular item
  of information has been updated. The second is used to tell you when
  any new information is added beneath a particular category. For example,
  to be told when the information on the NISS information service is
  updated, send the following commands:
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Services/niss
    register update
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Every time the information on the NISS information service is
  <p>
    updated (ie changed) you will now be sent a message to tell you</p>
  <p>
    about it. Later you may want to stop these messages being sent to</p>
  <p>
    you, so send the following:
  </p>
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Services/niss
    deregister update
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Then you will no longer get the messages telling you about changes.
