    MediaView is a multimedia digital publication system.  Published
    works on  MediaView are cited in its online Help facility.  MediaView
    is not public domain, rather  the Regents of the University of
    California (UC manages LANL) retain ownership.   While there's no
    charge for MediaView, users are enjoined from profiting from its use.
    Custom components make MediaView indefinitely extensible.  The source
    for 2 of  them is currently on the archive, as well as a document
    which describes their API.
    There are also 10 MediaView demo documents available. In most cases,
    a figure appearing in a document is actually a button.  When in
    doubt, click anything in sight.
    I'll be gradually adding to this collection and I encourage others to
    do the same.  I hope MediaView and its products will become a model
    for sharing of creations. This includes not only documents, but
    custom components as well.
