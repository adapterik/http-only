  <h1>Reading News with W3</h1>
  The <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/374" original-href="Overview.html" archive-page-id="374">lists  of internet newsgroups</a> are provided to allow you to browse
  through to see what is available.   Some of the parts have been edited
  by hand to make them easier to read, some parts have been automatically
  generated.  
  <p>
    You will only be able to read a newsgroup if your LOCAL newsserver
    carries it -- with W3 just like with any other newsreader.   This
    is because, wheras W3 normally works by reading the information directly
    from source, when it reads news it looks for the nearest copy which
    has been broadcast over the news network. That is how news works,
    and it is illegal to pass it on in other ways.  Sites differ in which
    sets of news they deem useful and appropriate.</p>
  <p>
    If you have trouble reading news, its probably because you haven't
    told your W3 browser what news server to use. See <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/770" original-href="../../WWW/LineMode/Defaults/NewsServer.html" archive-page-id="770">instructions</a> .
