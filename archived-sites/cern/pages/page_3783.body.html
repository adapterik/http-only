  <h1>Getting Indexes</h1>
  In order to move around, it is necessary to know where you can go
  to. This is achieved using the `index' command. For example, the following
  commands list the top level index:
  <xmp>
    start
    top
    index
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  After obeying this command, CONCISE will send you a message containing
  an index (ie. a list) of all the main categories. In the example shown
  in the diagram (?) this would be:
  <xmp>
    COSINE
    Networks
    Services
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  Having obtained an index of the top level, you may goto one of the
  items returned in the list, and perform another index eg:
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Services
    index
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  You would then get a list of Services sent to you. This process can
  be continued eg:
  <xmp>
    start
    goto /Networks/dfn
    index
  </xmp>
  <pre></pre>
  able to get an index as you will have reached the most detailed index.</div>
