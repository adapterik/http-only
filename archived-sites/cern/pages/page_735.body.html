  <h1>Installing te basic httop daemon</h1>
  The usual way to install a daemon is to either run it from the bootstrap
  command file (for example /etc/rc) so that it runs continuously, or
  to set up the internet daemon (inetd) to run it when a call comes
  in. 
  <p>
    Remember to make a <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/738" original-href="RuleFile.html" archive-page-id="738">rule file</a> unless you explicitly supress it with
    the -R option.

  <h2><a name="2">Using the Internet daemon</a></h2>
  There is a csh script to do this for a BSD unix system. You might
  want to edit it to run on other systems. 
  <p>
    Otherwise, just follow the <a name="9" href="/archive/cern/1795" original-href="Inetd.html" archive-page-id="1795">instructions for installing a server under
      the internet daemon</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Log file</h2>
  If  a log file is required,  make sure that the user name under which
  the daemon is run  has the right to write the file
