  <h1>Document caching</h1>
  Three operations in the retrieval of a document may take significant
  time:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/279" original-href="Formats.html#4" archive-page-id="279">Format conversion</a> by the server, including <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/234" original-href="Versioning.html#3" archive-page-id="234">version regeneration</a>
    </li>
    <li>Data transmission across the network
    </li>
    <li>Format conversion by the browser
    </li>
  </ul>
  At each stage, the server (in the first case) or browser (in the other
  cases) may decide to keep a temporary copy of the result.  This copy
  should ideally be common to many browsers.
  <p>
    Automatic caching relieves the user of having to explicitly save things
    which may be referred to again. It also relieves the system of keeping
    multiple copies (one for each user who has read the document). It
    allows local disk space to used optimally. Cache management takes
    into account such factors as
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="2" href="#1">expiry date</a>
    </li>
    <li>file size
    </li>
    <li>time taken to get the file
    </li>
    <li>frequency of access
    </li>
    <li>time since access
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="1">Expiry date</a></h2>
  As a guide to help a cache program optimise the data it caches, it
  is useful if a document is transmitted with an estimate by the server
  of the lengt of time the data may be kept for.  This allows fast changing
  documents to be flushed from the system, preventing readers from being
  mislead.  (I would not propose any notification of document changes
  to be distributed to cache managers automatically). For example, an
  RFC may be cached for years, while the state of the alarm system may
  be marked as valid for only one minute.
  <p>
    Window-oriented browsers effectively cache documents when they keep
    several at a time in memory, in different windows. In this case, for
    very volatile data, it may be useful to have the browser automatically
    refresh the window when its data expires. </p>
