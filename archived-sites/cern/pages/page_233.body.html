  <h1>Topology</h1>
  Here are a few questions about the underlying connectivity of  a hypertext
  web.
  <h2>Are links two- or multi-ended?</h2>
  The term "link" normally indeicates with two ends. Variations of this
  are liks with multiple sources and/or multiple destinations, and constructs
  which relate more than two anchors. The latter map onto logic description
  systems, predicate calculus, etc. See the "Aquanet" system  from Xerox
  PARC - paper at HT91).  This is a natural step from hypertext whose
  the links are typed with semantic content.   For example, the relation
  "Document A is a basis for document B given argument C". From now
  on however, let us restrict ourselves to links in the conventional
  sense, that is, with two ends.
  <h2>
    <a name="14">Should the links be  monodirectional or bidirectional</a>? </h2>
  If they are bidirectional, a link always exists in the reverse direction.
  A disadvantage of this being enforced is that it might constrain the
  author of a hypertext - he might want to constrain the reader.  However,
  an advantage is that often, when a link is made between two nodes,
  it is made in one direction in the mind of its author, but another
  reader may be more interested in the reverse link. Put another way,
  bidirectional linking allows the system to deduce the inverse relationship,
  that if A includes B, for example, that B is part of A. This effectively
  adds information for free. This is important when a critical parameter
  of the system is how long it takes someone to create a link.
  <p>
    KMS and hypercard have  one-way links; Enquire has  two-way links.</p>
  <p>
    There is a question of how one can make a two-way link to a protected
    database. The automatic addition of the reverse link is very useful
    for enhancing the information content of the database.  See also:<a name="2" href="/archive/cern/228" original-href="Multiuser.html#3" archive-page-id="228">
      Private overlaid web</a> , <a name="3" href="/archive/cern/270" original-href="../../Conferences/../Products/Microcosm/Microcosm.html#GenericLinking" archive-page-id="270">Generic Links</a> .</p>
  <p>
    It may be useful to have bidirectional links from the point of view
    of managing data. For example: if a document is destroyed or moved,
    one is aware of what dangling links will be created, and can possibly
    fix them.</p>
  <p>
    A compromise that links be one-way in the data model, but that a reverse
    link is created when any link is made, so long as this can be done
    without infringing protection. An alternative is for the reverse links
    to be gathered by a background process operating on a basically monodirectionally
    linked web. See <a name="13" href="/archive/cern/229" original-href="BuildingBackLinks.html" archive-page-id="229">Building Back-links</a>.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="12">Should anchors have more than one link?</a></h2>
  There is a design issue in whether one anchor may lead to many links,
  and/or on link have many anchors. It seems reasonable for many anchors
  to lead to the same reference. If one source anchor leads to more
  than one destination anchor, then there will be ambiguity if the anchor
  is clicked on with a mouse. This could be resolved by providing a
  menu to the user, but I feel this would complicate it too much. I
  therefore suggest a many-to-one mapping. <a name="8" href="/archive/cern/24" original-href="../People.html#groff" archive-page-id="24">JFG</a> disagrees and would like
  to see a small menu presented to the user if the link was ambiguous.<a name="9" href="/archive/cern/270" original-href="../../Products/Microcosm/Microcosm.html" archive-page-id="270">
    Microcosm</a> does this.
  <h2><a name="4">Should links be typed?</a></h2>
  A typed link carries some semantic information, which allows the system
  to manage data more efficiently on behalf of the user.  A default
  type ("untyped") normally exists in some form when types are implemented.
  See also a  <a name="1" href="/archive/cern/852" original-href="LinkTypes.html" archive-page-id="852">list of some types</a> . (Should a link be allowed to have
  many types? (-<a name="6" href="/archive/cern/24" original-href="../People.html#groff" archive-page-id="24"> JFG</a> )  I don't think so: that should be represented
  by more than one link.(-<a name="7" href="/archive/cern/24" original-href="../People.html#BernersLee" archive-page-id="24"> TBL</a> ))
  <p>
    Link typing helps with the generation of <a name="10" href="/archive/cern/230" original-href="Navigation.html#6" archive-page-id="230">graphical overviews</a> , and
    with <a name="11" href="/archive/cern/942" original-href="TracingLinks.html" archive-page-id="942">automatic tracing</a> .
  </p>
  <h2>Should links contain ancillary information?</h2>
  Does the system allow dating, versioning, authorship, comment text
  on a link?  If so, how is it displayed and accessed? This sort of
  information complicates the issue, in that readable information is
  no longer carried within node contents only. Pretty soon, following
  this path leads to a link becoming a node in itself, annotatable and
  all.  This perverts the data model significantly, and I cannot see
  that that is a good idea. Information about the link can always be
  put in the source node, or in an intermediate node, for example an
  annotation. However, this makes tracing more difficult. It is certainly
  nice to be able to put a comment on a link. Perhaps one should make
  a link annotatable. I think not.
  <h2>Should a link contain Preview information?</h2>
  This is information stored at the source to allow the reader to check
  whether he wants to follow a link before he goes. I feel that the
  system may cache some data (such as the target node title), or the
  writer of the node may include some descriptive material in the highlighted
  spot, but it is not necessary to include preview information just
  because access may be slow. Caching should be done instead of corrupting
  the user interface. If you have a fast <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/230" original-href="Navigation.html#6" archive-page-id="230">graphic overview</a> , this could
  remove the necessity for a preview function.</div>
