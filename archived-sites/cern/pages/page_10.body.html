  <h1>World-Wide Web News November 1992</h1>
  (As usual, this is distributed in
  plain text form, but the original
  hypertext contains lots of links
  and may be read as http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/News/9211.html.
  If you don't have World-Wide Web
  software yet, telnet to info.cern.ch
  (128.141.201.74), and select information
  about the WorldWide Web.)
  <h2>Client software</h2>
  Three developments on the clients
  side. Tony Johnson of Boston University,
  developer of the <a name="10" href="/archive/cern/42" original-href="../MidasWWW/Status.html" archive-page-id="42">MidasWWW</a> browser
  for Motif, has ported it now to four
  X11 platforms and has a tar file
  of sources available on ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src
  or ftp://freehep.scri.fsu.edu/freehep/networking_news_email/midaswww
  as  midaswww_1.0.tar.Z Tony also
  has  plans to include graphics and
  text editing in the future.
  <p>
    Here at CERN, Nicola Pellow is back
    until the end of the year, and has
    picked up the <a name="11" href="/archive/cern/43" original-href="../Macintosh/Status.html" archive-page-id="43">Mac Browser</a> .  She
    has a pre-alpha with basic functionality
    up, watch this space for the first
    release.</p>
  <p>
    The full-screen client (using curses)
    has been released by Jim Whitescarver
    of NJIT, see <a name="12" href="/archive/cern/44" original-href="../Curses/Release_00.html" archive-page-id="44">release note</a> for details.</p>
  <p>
    The NeXTStep client has been revised.
    The 0.13 version generated bad SGML
    at times, so anyone using it to write
    hypertext is advised to upgrade to
    0.14 immediately.  The binary is
    in ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next/WorldWideWeb_0.14.app.tar.Z
  </p>
  <h2>More and more hypertext on line</h2>
  New W3 servers have appeared at <a name="4" href="/archive/cern/45">KVI</a>
  ad at <a name="6" href="/archive/cern/46" original-href="//ftp.cwi.nl/pub/www/default.html" archive-page-id="46">CWI</a> both in the Netherlands,<a name="3" href="/archive/cern/47">
    IN2P3</a>  in France, and <a name="2" href="/archive/cern/48">NCSA</a>  in Illinois,
  USA.  KVI and IN2P3 are both High
  Energy Physics  institites. All the
  servers have local information as
  well as various other goodies.
  <p>
    CWI has a hypertext version of the
    Gnu documentation and of a guide
    to <a name="7" href="/archive/cern/49" original-href="//ftp.cwi.nl/pub/www/audio-formats/a00.html" archive-page-id="49">Audio formats</a> ,  and NCSA has
    many things including hypertext documentation
    for the <a name="5" href="/archive/cern/50">X-Collage</a> system.  Two CERN
    projects to produce online hypertext
    documentation recently are ADAMO
    and <a name="z13" href="/archive/cern/51">RD13</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, <a name="8" href="/archive/cern/52">Cornell Law school</a> have
    a server  with hypertext of US Copyright
    Law... as law tends to be mostly
    cross-reference ("as defined in Sect1.2.2.(a)
    above") hypertext makes a lot of
    sense here!
  </p>
  <h2>Browse the WAIS servers</h2>
  It's sometimes been a bit difficult
  browsing through what there is in
  the WAIS world. Now, looking for
  information under "types of server"
  on the web will lead you to hypertext
  lists of WAIS servers arranged by
  name of "source" and by internet
  domain. These lists are generated
  automatically at CERN from TMC's
  catalogue. Clicking on the source
  name takes you directly to the index.
  Currently there are 310 databases
  on 88 hosts accesible.
