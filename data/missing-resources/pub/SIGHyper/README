SIGhyper/README						  1.2/1991-11-11

These documents are from the SGML Users' Group's (SGML-UG) Special
Interest Group on Hypertext and Multimedia (SIGhyper).	SIGhyper
documents and general information are available via anonymous FTP from

	ftp.ifi.uio.no			[129.240.64.2]

in the directory

	SIGhyper

(There is also mirror FTP site at MAILER.CC.FSU.EDU, directory pub/sgml.)

All new documents will be announced in the USENET group comp.text.sgml
as they become available.  If (and only if) you can't use FTP service,
you may request the document via the Internet from

	<SIGhyper-request@ifi.uio.no>.

(Note: Each such request must be fulfilled manually.)  If SIGhyper
members wish to be personally updated on new documents available from
the FTP archive, they should send a note to that effect to the same
address.
