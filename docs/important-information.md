# Important Information

So, if you had to reduce your "web" to 10 different sites, or tranches of information which could be sites (e.g. encyclopedia, dictionary) what would they be?

For this site, we are starting the the original CERN info site. 

What else?

It would be nice to have daily news, but that may be asking for too much. Will investigate open source news ... I did this once briefly, and found that the guardian does provide free access via an API. It might be nicer to have a daily published paper ... it could be stored statically and could always be referred to directly and will always be the same.

Calendars of significant events would be nice. If we really focus on this, we could incorporate any number of calendars to delight the viewer! 

Related? Historical events, with more details?

Some daily web applications like weather, live news, social media, etc. are out of scope.

Core works:

Focus on US for now:

dictionary
